# Economic Priority System

## Priority Hierarchy

1. **Player Market (GCC)** - Always try players first
2. **NPC Trade (Virtual Ledger)** - If no players available
3. **Earth Import (USD)** - Last resort only

## AI Manager Decision Flow

AI Manager uses a data-driven decision flow to source materials, always prioritizing player engagement and self-sufficiency.

## Economic Intelligence

- **Buy Order Pricing**: Dynamic pricing based on market conditions
- **Timeout/Fallback Logic**: Automatic escalation through priority levels
- **Performance Tracking**: Metrics on self-sufficiency and player engagement

## GCC Currency System

- **Initial Coupling**: GCC coupled to USD to bootstrap lunar market
- **Decoupling**: Eventually becomes independent galactic currency
- **Market Dynamics**: Virtual ledger for NPC transactions, player-driven GCC economy
- **Minting Mechanism**: Lunar Currency Authority Satellite (LCAS) mints GCC at controlled rate for LDC resource budget
- **Dual Currency**: GCC for player transactions; USD restricted to NPC corp-to-corp use
- **Adoption Incentives**: LDC pays employees/contracts in GCC; offers subsidies/grants; provides exclusive access to services/resources
- **Governance**: LDC sets transaction fees, block rewards, staking rules; players may influence via reputation/actions
- **Security**: Integrated wallets with cybersecurity challenges; potential for hacks or fraud
- **Supply Model**: Hybrid - hard cap on core supply (80%) for scarcity; controlled minting on reserve (20%) for flexibility and crisis response
- **Inactive Account Handling**: Escheatment after prolonged inactivity; reclaimed GCC redistributed via LDC grants or algorithmic minting to maintain circulation

## Power Credits (Venus Energy Trade Framework)

- **Concept**: Units of Venus-based production capacity representing energy surplus from solar harvesting arrays
- **Trade Mechanism**: Used in long-term contracts to offset material imports by offering energy-intensive goods (carbon nanotubes, supercapacitors, atmospheric fuels) at reduced export cost
- **Implementation**: Energy surplus transformed into manufactured products or stored fuels, traded via conventional cargo transfers (e.g., cycler ships)
- **Economic Role**: Ensures Venus remains a major player despite limited raw minerals, leveraging abundant energy as a diplomatic and economic asset
- **Integration**: Complements GCC system for interplanetary trade, particularly with Luna Development Corporation (LDC) and Martian Terraforming Authority (MTA)

## Hybrid Market System

- **Fixed Prices for Basics**: Essential goods (ammunition, basic repairs) sold at NPC vendors with stable prices
- **Player-Driven Advanced Market**: Rare/advanced goods traded via buy/sell orders with dynamic pricing
- **NPC Stabilizers**: LDC posts buy/sell orders to maintain price floors/ceilings, preventing extreme volatility

## GCC Faucets and Sinks

- **Faucets**: LDC mission payouts funded by LCAS-minted GCC; guaranteed buy orders for lunar resources
- **Sinks**: Reprocessing/manufacturing fees at LDC facilities; import duties for Earth goods; base upkeep costs
- **Import System**: Players request Earth imports via LDC, paying GCC; LDC uses USD reserves for procurement

## Byproduct Economics

### Slag to Processed Slag Conversion

- **Source Material**: 'Slag' is a byproduct generated during asteroid hollowing operations, representing 70% of the excavated mass from captured asteroids (Phobos, Deimos, or large asteroids).
- **Processing Chain**: Raw slag undergoes refinement to become 'Processed Slag', a high-efficiency fuel optimized for Asteroid Propulsion Modules.
- **Economic Benefit**: Conversion reduces the cost of orbital maneuvers by providing abundant, low-cost reaction mass for propulsion systems.
- **Value Creation**: Transforms waste material into a strategic resource, lowering operational expenses for tug operations and enabling cost-effective relocation of moon-scale objects.
- **Integration**: Processed slag fuels the modular civilization concept, supporting the unplug-and-move paradigm for cyclers and habitats.

## Wormhole Logistics & Trade

- **Matching Pair Rule**: Artificial Wormhole Stations must be deployed in matched pairs for gravitational counterbalance, requiring coordinated resource allocation across systems
- **Local Harvesting Bonus**: Station operations near natural wormhole anomalies receive a 25% efficiency bonus for EM extraction, reducing operational costs and accelerating network expansion
- **Slag-Propulsion Economy**: Hollowing slag is used as reaction mass for relocation operations, reducing tug fuel costs by 90% through abundant, low-cost propulsion material derived from asteroid excavation byproducts
- **Act 2 Urbanization**: These logistics rules enable the transition to permanent urbanized wormhole networks by optimizing EM supply chains and infrastructure deployment

## Consortium Integration

- **Transit Fees**: Revenue from wormhole usage
- **Dividends**: Returns to member corporations
- **Route Proposals**: Player voting on expansion priorities
