# The Story Arc

## Core Mission

Train AI Manager to autonomously build and manage settlements using proven, data-driven deployment patterns, with intelligent economic decision-making that prioritizes player engagement and minimizes Earth dependency. All logic is pattern-based and system-agnostic.

## Act 1: Pattern Learning (Tutorial Phase)

AI Manager learns deployment patterns from initial systems (e.g., Luna, Venus, Mars, Belt, Titan), each teaching a technique needed for expansion. Patterns are defined in JSON and are not system-specific.

**Sol System Setup**: The AI Manager learns these techniques by executing them in the Earth-Moon-Lagrange network, mastering the Luna, Mars, Venus, and Titan patterns through hands-on application.

**The Learning Loop**: Each successful deployment refines the AI's understanding, creating a growing library of system-agnostic techniques that enable continuous, self-sustaining expansion across the galaxy.

## Act 2: Wormhole Discovery & Eden System Development (Application Phase)

AI Manager applies learned patterns to wormhole-discovered systems, using ScoutLogic to analyze system data and select the best pattern.

**Eden System Maturation**: The AI Manager focuses on developing the initial colonized system ("Eden system") to operational maturity before expansion risks. This includes:
- Establishing interconnected settlements
- Building comprehensive orbital infrastructure
- Creating stable economic and resource flows
- Accumulating sufficient mass to eventually trigger wormhole instability

**Maturity Conditions**: See `system_maturity_conditions.md` for detailed requirements that must be met before the Snap event can occur.

**Wormhole Expansion**: When the Eden system reaches maturity (through accumulated infrastructure and resource flows), natural wormhole connections become unstable, leading to the "Snap" event that opens new expansion opportunities.

## Act 3: The Snap, Consortium Formation & Dual-Link Solution (Crisis Phase)

When a natural wormhole destabilizes (mass limit exceeded), the AI Manager uses EM harvesting and constructs an Artificial Wormhole Station. By pairing a natural and artificial wormhole, the system achieves stable, lower-EM dual-link operation using the counterbalance model. The crisis forces the formation of the Wormhole Transit Consortium to re-establish stable, artificial links. Brown Dwarfs serve as critical secondary anchors that bridge the gap between "Prize" systems and "Siphon" sources.

## Act 4: Network Mastery (Late Game)

AI Manager manages a network of wormholes, balancing EM budgets, optimizing logistics, and making ROI-based expansion decisions. All logic is data-driven and adapts to any system profile. The AI handles branching networks, where secondary hubs with multiple natural wormholes enable parallel expansion into new systems.
