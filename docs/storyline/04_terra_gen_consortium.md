# TerraGen Terraforming Consortium

## Formation Context
Formed in the aftermath of the first major snap events, when the Sol system gained access to multiple new star systems with terraformable worlds. The sudden expansion created unprecedented colonization opportunities but also the need for coordinated terraforming expertise.

## Founding Principles
TerraGen represents the institutional response to the terraforming challenges presented by newly accessible systems. Just as the Wormhole Transit Consortium solved the logistics crisis, TerraGen addresses the colonization bottleneck.

## Key Functions
- **Technology Standardization**: Develops common terraforming protocols across different planetary types
- **Resource Sharing**: Pools rare biological materials and terraforming organisms
- **Knowledge Exchange**: Shares terraforming data and lessons learned between systems
- **Economic Coordination**: Manages terraforming contracts and settlement development funding

## Founding Members
- **Established DCs**: LDC, Mars Development Corporation, Venus Development Corporation (for atmospheric expertise)
- **New System Representatives**: Corporations from recently colonized systems
- **Specialized Suppliers**: Companies providing terraforming technology and biological materials

## Integration with Wormhole Network
TerraGen's success depends on the Wormhole Transit Consortium's logistics network, while TerraGen provides the destination worlds that justify network expansion. This creates a virtuous cycle of exploration and colonization.

## Governance
Similar to the Wormhole Transit Consortium, TerraGen uses a voting system based on investment and contribution, with founding members having special governance rights.
