# TerraGen Terraforming Consortium

## Formation Context
Formed in the aftermath of the first major snap events, when the Sol system gained access to multiple new star systems with terraformable worlds. The sudden expansion created unprecedented colonization opportunities but also the need for coordinated terraforming expertise.

## Founding Principles
TerraGen represents the institutional response to the terraforming challenges presented by newly accessible systems. Just as the Wormhole Transit Consortium solved the logistics crisis, TerraGen addresses the colonization bottleneck.

## Key Functions
- **Technology Development**: Focuses on advancing new terraforming technologies and methodologies for diverse planetary environments
- **Resource Identification**: Analyzes planetary compositions to identify specific resources needed for terraforming (e.g., CO2, N2, biological materials)
- **Mission Coordination**: Offers player missions for resource harvesting and inter-system resource transport to support terraforming plans
- **Technology Standardization**: Develops common terraforming protocols across different planetary types
- **Resource Sharing**: Pools rare biological materials and terraforming organisms
- **Knowledge Exchange**: Shares terraforming data and lessons learned between systems
- **Economic Coordination**: Manages terraforming contracts and settlement development funding

## Player Mission Examples
TerraGen contracts players for critical terraforming support missions, often in coordination with the AI Manager's wormhole planning:

- **Resource Harvesting**: Extract raw CO2 and N2 from Venus for Mars' atmospheric buildup (paid by receiving world's local DC)
- **Inter-System Transport**: Move terraforming organisms or materials between colonized systems
- **Survey Operations**: Map planetary resources and assess terraforming potential
- **Technology Testing**: Deploy experimental terraforming equipment on new worlds
- **Pre-Snap Harvesting**: When wormholes shift to resource-rich systems that the AI Manager hasn't prioritized for permanent connection, TerraGen offers time-sensitive missions to harvest valuable resources before the planned "hammer event" closes the wormhole

## AI Manager Integration
TerraGen missions are coordinated with the AI Manager's wormhole network planning:
- **Hammer Events**: AI Manager schedules specific game-time events to intentionally close wormholes and trigger controlled snaps
- **Resource Windows**: Temporary access to new systems creates harvesting opportunities before permanent infrastructure is built
- **Mission Timing**: Players receive advance notice of impending hammer events, creating urgency for resource extraction missions

## Founding Members
- **Established DCs**: LDC, Mars Development Corporation, Venus Development Corporation (for atmospheric expertise)
- **New System Representatives**: Corporations from recently colonized systems
- **Specialized Suppliers**: Companies providing terraforming technology and biological materials

## Integration with Wormhole Network
TerraGen's success depends on the Wormhole Transit Consortium's logistics network, while TerraGen provides the destination worlds that justify network expansion. This creates a virtuous cycle of exploration and colonization.

## Governance
Similar to the Wormhole Transit Consortium, TerraGen uses a voting system based on investment and contribution, with founding members having special governance rights.
