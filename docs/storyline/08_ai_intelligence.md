# AI Manager Intelligence & Memory Systems

## Survey Data Persistence

- **Wormhole Location Database**: Stores precise coordinates of detected natural wormholes for future artificial wormhole targeting
- **EM Signature Mapping**: Maintains historical EM detection data to identify EM-rich systems and track wormhole activity patterns
- **System Survey History**: Remembers detailed survey results to avoid redundant scanning and enable comparative analysis

## Strategic Memory Applications

- **Artificial Wormhole Planning**: Uses stored natural wormhole locations as target coordinates for artificial wormhole creation
- **EM Resource Assessment**: Prioritizes systems with residual EM signatures for network expansion opportunities
- **Network Optimization**: Leverages historical data to predict wormhole stability and optimize counterbalance station placement

## EM Harvesting Priority

- **Network Fuel Priority**: AI must prioritize EM extraction operations to fuel the artificial wormhole network, ensuring sustained connectivity and expansion capabilities
- **Resource Allocation**: Diverts construction and logistics resources toward EM harvesting infrastructure when network stability is threatened
- **Act 2 Urbanization**: These prioritization rules facilitate the transition to urbanized wormhole networks by maintaining EM supply chains for permanent anchor stations

## Data-Driven Intelligence Loop

- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies recurring EM signatures and wormhole behavior patterns across surveyed systems
- **Predictive Analysis**: Uses historical survey data to anticipate EM availability and wormhole stability in unexplored regions
- **Strategic Targeting**: Focuses expansion efforts on systems with proven EM potential or known wormhole locations
- **Prize World Recognition**: Identifies "Prize" worlds via `tei_score` attribute in loaded JSON files (TEI > 80% triggers priority colonization flag)

## Mission Logging & Identifier Consistency

- **Sanitized Identifier Usage**: All AI mission logging and system references use sanitized [System]-[Letter] format identifiers (e.g., "AOL-732356-b") enforced during system loading
- **Legacy Compatibility**: Ensures consistent alphanumeric identifiers across AI operations, UI display, and data persistence
- **Exploration Phase**: Maintains scientific catalog naming during scout missions and probe deployments
- **Asteroid Resource Extraction**: When targeting asteroids for resource extraction, AI must use sanitized AST identifiers (e.g., "AOL-732356-AST-35") for logistics tracking and mission coordination
- **Gravity Threshold Logic**: If planetary gravity > 3.0g, AI prioritizes Infrastructure-First deployment over Settlement-First to ensure operational safety and equipment longevity
- **Asteroid-First Mandate**: AI must prioritize hollowing an asteroid (MK1-HA) over modular construction (MK1-H) if a target asteroid is within 0.1 AU of the deployment location, enabling rapid infrastructure establishment through asteroid-based builds

## AI Manager Performance Metrics

- **Self-Sufficiency**: Local production ratio, Earth import dependency, USD debt
- **Player Economy**: Engagement ratio, buy order fulfillment, active contracts
- **NPC Network**: Trade efficiency, Virtual Ledger utilization, specialization
- **Operational**: Stalled projects, shortages, construction queue idle time
