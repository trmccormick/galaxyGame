# The Crisis: The "Snap" & Exit-Shift

## The Trigger: The "Snap"

A natural wormhole snaps when its mass-limit is exceeded, but this occurs only after a two-stage maturity process: first the core system must develop sufficient expansion pressure, then the destination system must accumulate infrastructure mass to trigger instability.

**Two-Stage Maturity Requirements** (Before Snap Can Occur):

**Stage 1: Core System Expansion Readiness**
- ✅ **Population Pressure**: Earth/Luna population exceeds sustainable limits (>50M)
- ✅ **Economic Capacity**: GCC reserves sufficient for major expansion (>100B GCC)
- ✅ **Technological Readiness**: Inter-system transportation infrastructure operational
- ✅ **Resource Surplus**: Core system producing excess resources for export

**Stage 2: Destination System Mass Accumulation**
- ✅ **Infrastructure Threshold**: Combined settlement and orbital infrastructure mass
- ✅ **Resource Flow Maturity**: Regular heavy cargo transport established
- ✅ **Economic Activity**: Active trade routes and resource extraction operations
- ✅ **Counterbalance Effects**: System-specific stability multipliers (Eden: 0.6 vs Sol: 1.0)

**Mass Limits**: Base 500k tons × stability multiplier = system-specific limits
- **Sol System**: 500,000 tons (perfect Jupiter counterbalance)
- **Eden System**: 300,000 tons (offset gas giant positioning)

**The Result**: The exit shifts from System A to System B, keeping Sol stable but orphaning the original colony.

**The Reconnection Drive**: This crisis forces the formation of the Wormhole Transit Consortium to re-establish stable, artificial links.

## Simple Analogy: The Rubber Band

Think of a natural wormhole like a rubber band connecting two points.

- **The Snap**: If you try to pull too much mass (cargo/ships) through the rubber band at once, it reaches its tension limit and "snaps."
- **The Shift**: Unlike a real rubber band, the wormhole doesn't just disappear; the loose end "flicks" away from its original destination.
- **The Result**: The origin point (Sol) remains stable and anchored, but the exit point shifts to a different, random location in deep space, leaving the original colony "orphaned" and isolated.

## Maturity-Based Snap Timing

### Eden System Development Phases
The "Eden system" (initial colonized system) must reach operational maturity before the snap can be triggered:

**Phase 1: Initial Establishment** (Foundation)
- Basic settlements operational
- Orbital infrastructure minimal
- Resource extraction beginning
- **Snap Risk**: Very Low (insufficient mass flow)

**Phase 2: Infrastructure Growth** (Development)
- Multiple settlements interconnected
- Orbital depots and stations operational
- Regular cycler routes established
- **Snap Risk**: Moderate (growing mass accumulation)

**Phase 3: Economic Maturity** (Maturity)
- Complex trade networks active
- Heavy industry operational
- Large-scale resource flows
- **Snap Risk**: High (approaching mass limits)

**Phase 4: Snap Trigger** (Crisis Point)
- System reaches critical mass threshold
- Natural wormhole destabilizes
- Exit shifts to new system
- **Snap Risk**: Triggered (mass limit exceeded)

### Mass Accumulation Triggers
The snap occurs when accumulated infrastructure and cargo flows exceed wormhole stability limits:

- **Settlement Mass**: Multiple large habitats and industrial facilities
- **Orbital Infrastructure**: Stations, depots, satellites, and construction platforms
- **Cycler Operations**: Regular heavy cargo transport between systems
- **Resource Flows**: Large-scale material transport for construction and trade

**Detailed Maturity Requirements**: See `system_maturity_conditions.md` for comprehensive maturity metrics and thresholds that must be met before snap events can occur.

## Controlled Snap Expansion Strategy

### Seeding Phase
The AI Manager uses the high-mass capacity of natural wormholes to "seed" new systems with infrastructure.

### Phased Stabilization
First deploys orbiting stabilization satellites to gather expelled EM and refocus it at the wormhole throat for immediate stability, then constructs permanent Artificial Wormhole Stations (AWS) which replace the temporary satellites.

### The Mass Trigger
Once local infrastructure is established, the AI retrieves stabilization satellites and cycles a high-mass Cycler Fleet through the link, intentionally triggering a "Snap" or "Shift" to a new system (e.g., from System B to System C).

### Standby Activation
Systems "orphaned" by the snap immediately activate pre-built Artificial Wormhole Stations (AWS) to reconnect to the existing network backbone (e.g., reconnecting B to A).

### Shift Event Handling
When a wormhole shifts location, AWS infrastructure must be rebuilt at the new natural wormhole position to maintain EM harvesting capability, preserving any existing counterbalance stations for gravitational stability.
