# The Crisis: The "Snap" & Exit-Shift

## The Trigger: The "Snap"

A natural wormhole snaps when its mass-limit is exceeded.

**The Result**: The exit shifts from System A to System B, keeping Sol stable but orphaning the original colony.

**The Reconnection Drive**: This crisis forces the formation of the Wormhole Transit Consortium to re-establish stable, artificial links.

## Simple Analogy: The Rubber Band

Think of a natural wormhole like a rubber band connecting two points.

- **The Snap**: If you try to pull too much mass (cargo/ships) through the rubber band at once, it reaches its tension limit and "snaps."
- **The Shift**: Unlike a real rubber band, the wormhole doesn't just disappear; the loose end "flicks" away from its original destination.
- **The Result**: The origin point (Sol) remains stable and anchored, but the exit point shifts to a different, random location in deep space, leaving the original colony "orphaned" and isolated.

## Controlled Snap Expansion Strategy

### Seeding Phase
The AI Manager uses the high-mass capacity of natural wormholes to "seed" new systems with infrastructure.

### Phased Stabilization
First deploys orbiting stabilization satellites to gather expelled EM and refocus it at the wormhole throat for immediate stability, then constructs permanent Artificial Wormhole Stations (AWS) which replace the temporary satellites.

### The Mass Trigger
Once local infrastructure is established, the AI retrieves stabilization satellites and cycles a high-mass Cycler Fleet through the link, intentionally triggering a "Snap" or "Shift" to a new system (e.g., from System B to System C).

### Standby Activation
Systems "orphaned" by the snap immediately activate pre-built Artificial Wormhole Stations (AWS) to reconnect to the existing network backbone (e.g., reconnecting B to A).

### Shift Event Handling
When a wormhole shifts location, AWS infrastructure must be rebuilt at the new natural wormhole position to maintain EM harvesting capability, preserving any existing counterbalance stations for gravitational stability.
