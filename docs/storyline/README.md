# Galaxy Game Storyline & Lore

This folder contains the complete narrative framework for the Galaxy Game's wormhole expansion system. The storyline guides all game events, technological progression, and AI behavior.

## Overview

The wormhole expansion storyline is divided into four acts, with detailed mechanics for crisis management, institutional frameworks, and physics-based topology. This narrative ensures consistent world-building and player engagement.

## Contents

- **[01_story_arc.md](01_story_arc.md)**: The four-act narrative structure
- **[02_crisis_mechanics.md](02_crisis_mechanics.md)**: The "Snap" event and controlled expansion
- **[03_consortium_framework.md](03_consortium_framework.md)**: Institutional governance and economics
- **[04_physics_topology.md](04_physics_topology.md)**: Brown dwarf hubs and wormhole physics
- **[05_deployment_hierarchy.md](05_deployment_hierarchy.md)**: ISRU philosophy and settlement patterns
- **[06_ai_intelligence.md](06_ai_intelligence.md)**: AI learning systems and memory
- **[07_economic_systems.md](07_economic_systems.md)**: Priority systems and market dynamics
- **[08_implementation_phases.md](08_implementation_phases.md)**: Technical rollout plan

## Key Principles

- **Player Engagement First**: All systems prioritize player interaction over NPC automation
- **Data-Driven Logic**: No hardcoded assumptions; all decisions based on system metadata
- **Self-Sufficiency**: ISRU philosophy minimizes Earth dependency
- **Crisis as Catalyst**: The "Snap" event drives institutional and technological evolution

## Integration with Technical Systems

This storyline informs:
- AI Manager decision-making algorithms
- Economic priority systems
- Mission profile selection
- Event triggering mechanisms
- Player progression arcs
