# Physics & Topology: The Brown Dwarf Hub

## Brown Dwarfs as Logistics Batteries

Brown Dwarfs act as unique "Logistics Batteries" due to their immense mass but lack of stellar radiation.

**Simple Analogy: The Failed Star Gas Station**
A Brown Dwarf is essentially a "failed star"—it has a massive gravitational pull like a star but doesn't produce enough heat or light to be habitable. This makes it the perfect Gas Station (Siphon) for the network.

## The Hub: L3 Lagrange Point
Because of its high mass, it provides a stable gravitational anchor for an Artificial Wormhole Station at the L3 Lagrange point (the "quiet spot" opposite the primary star).

## The Siphon: Volatile Resources
These systems are rich in volatiles (like Hydrogen and Nitrogen) but have no breathable atmosphere or sunlight.

## The Role: EM Fuel Production
The Consortium builds a hub here to "siphon" these gases. These gases are processed into the Exotic Matter (EM) fuel needed to keep the entire wormhole network from snapping.

## Strategic Importance
- **Primary Siphons**: Because they are rich in volatiles but "light-poor," the Consortium targets them as Primary Siphons to harvest the fuel needed to power the network's EM Inductors.
- **Gateway Systems**: Enable deeper, more remote systems through stable connections.
- **Branching Hubs**: Systems with multiple gas giants (e.g., two) can support more links, becoming regional junctions. If a second natural wormhole appears in a remote system, the AI Manager upgrades it to a Secondary Branch Hub, enabling recursive scouting into parallel frontier systems.

## System Capacity
- **Standard Gas Giant**: 1 Slot (L3)
- **Jupiter-Class**: 2 Slots (L3 + Direct Anchor)
- **Brown Dwarf**: 1 High-Stability Slot (L3), often used as a "Gateway" to deeper, more remote systems
