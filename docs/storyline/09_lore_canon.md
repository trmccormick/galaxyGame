# Lore Canon v0.1

This document establishes the canonical lore for the Galaxy Game, separating established narrative elements from design assumptions and undecided aspects. This prevents drift and ensures consistency across development.

## Era & Tone

### Confirmed Lore 🟦
- **Post-early space expansion, pre-FTL utopia**: Humanity is technologically advanced but resource-constrained, bound by physics (no casual faster-than-light travel).
- **Expansion is slow and deliberate**: Ships are slow, terraforming takes decades, logistics/mass/energy matter critically.
- **Institutional/corporate driven**: Colonization led by corporations, government-backed megaprojects, and consortiums. Player acts as coordinator/systems-level decision-maker, not a lone adventurer or ship captain.

### Design Assumption 🟨
- **Resource scarcity drives innovation**: Limited Earth resources force ISRU (In-Situ Resource Utilization) and self-sufficiency.
- **Multi-generational timescales**: Projects span decades, requiring long-term planning and automation.

## Expansion Drivers

### Confirmed Lore 🟦
- **Corporate entities**: Venus Development Corporation (VDC) for cloud cities, Mars-focused terraforming, Saturn/Titan system administration (SDC/TDC).
- **Consortium formation**: Wormhole Transit Consortium emerges from crisis, combining AstroLift (logistics) and LDC (construction).
- **Economic priorities**: Player market (GCC) first, NPC trade second, Earth imports last resort.
- **Squatter's rights ownership**: No single entity owns worlds; corporations establish bases through development, creating competitive settlement dynamics.
- **Lunar Development Corporation (LDC)**: Manages initial lunar settlements, focusing on material production and infrastructure.
- **Astrolift**: Operates orbital logistics, including LEO depots for refueling and interplanetary transport.
- **Early economic drivers**: Mars-Venus bilateral trade loop and Titan fuel production establish initial interplanetary commerce.

### Implied Lore 🟨
- **No unified galactic government**: Isolated systems, long communication delays, political fragmentation.
- **Exploration is dangerous**: Wormhole shifts can make systems unreachable, ships are slow, rescue not guaranteed → abandoned colonies and lost expeditions.

## Wormhole Truth

### Confirmed Lore 🟦
- **Natural wormholes exist as cosmic anomalies**: Discovered, not invented; appear/disappear unpredictably; connect star systems or deadspace.
- **Instability and mass limits**: Shared mass limits, environmental hazards, require stabilization satellites.
- **Story driver**: Anomalies create time pressure, first contact opportunities, and mystery elements.
- **Artificial wormholes as earned technology**: Built after mastering natural ones, representing power escalation.

### Undecided 🟥
- **Origin of anomalies**: Options include ancient civilization, natural phenomenon, or failed FTL experiment. **Needs decision** - this is a critical lore fork.

## Terraforming Philosophy

### Confirmed Lore 🟦
- **Civilizational project, not cosmetic**: Targets temperature/pressure, gradual atmosphere evolution, requires orbital infrastructure (solar shades, reflectors).
- **Venus ≠ surface bases**: Cloud cities first due to hostile surface.
- **Mars warming incremental and fragile**: Multi-generational gamble, not guaranteed success.
- **Titan's delicate balance**: Methane/ethane hydrological cycle highly sensitive to atmospheric pressure changes; significant reduction could destabilize surface liquids and alter composition.

### Design Assumption 🟨
- **Physics-based constraints**: All changes follow real atmospheric/planetary science principles.

## Player Role

### Confirmed Lore 🟦
- **Systems-level coordinator**: Manages multiple settlements, fleets, projects; makes strategic long-term decisions.

### Implied Lore 🟨
- **Program runner, not hero character**: Oversees automated systems with human oversight.

## AI & Automation in Lore

### Confirmed Lore 🟦
- **Highly automated systems**: Long-duration projects with minimal human micromanagement.

### Undecided 🟥
- **AI governance and ethics**: Human oversight, ethical constraints, AI decision-making boundaries. **Needs documentation** - narratively unexplored.

## Opening Scenario

### Undecided 🟥
- **Game start point**: Does it begin in Sol, during first extrasolar expansion, or at first anomaly discovery? **Needs decision**.
- **System development state**: Is Mars partially developed? Are Venus cloud cities experimental or established? **Needs clarification**.

## Tone of Failure

### Implied Lore 🟨
- **Permanent loss likely**: Systems can become unreachable, colonies abandoned. Rollback possible but difficult.

### Undecided 🟥
- **Canonical permanence**: Are failures permanent, or can lost systems be recovered? **Needs explicit ruling**.

## Implementation Notes

### Lore vs Mechanics Tags
- 🟦 **Lore-canonical**: Established narrative elements that inform design
- 🟨 **Design assumption**: Logical extensions that shaped mechanics
- 🟥 **Undecided**: Gaps requiring decision/documentation

### Next Steps
1. **Decide critical gaps**: Origin of wormholes, opening scenario, failure tone
2. **Recover old chats**: Search for keywords like "wormhole", "anomaly", "terraforming", "Venus", "timeline", "opening"
3. **Expand canon**: Add decided elements to this document
4. **Cross-reference**: Ensure all systems align with canonical lore

## Implementation Status

### Current Focus: System Stabilization
Many advanced narrative elements are **deferred until after system cleanup and stabilization**. The current priority is ensuring core wormhole expansion mechanics work reliably before adding optional narrative features.

### Future Enhancement Candidates
The following elements are planned for future implementation as optional features once the base system is stable:

- **Wormhole Origin Lore**: Ancient civilization, natural phenomenon, or failed FTL experiment backstories
- **Opening Scenario Variations**: Alternative starting points (extrasolar, post-first anomaly)
- **Advanced Failure Modes**: Permanent system loss vs recovery mechanics
- **AI Governance Narratives**: Human oversight and ethical constraint storylines
- **Extended Terraforming Lore**: Multi-generational project narratives and Venus cloud city histories

These will be revisited as optional content packs or expansion features after core functionality is solid.
