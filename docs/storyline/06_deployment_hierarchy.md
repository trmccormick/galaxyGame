# Deployment Hierarchy: Local-First (ISRU)

## Core Philosophy: ISRU (In-Situ Resource Utilization)

A core strategic philosophy used by the AI Manager to prioritize the use of local materials found on planets, moons, or asteroids rather than relying on expensive imports from Earth. This is the foundation of the Luna and Mars deployment patterns.

## To Lower the Cost of the "Gamble"

The AI Manager uses the Luna and Mars Patterns to build the network.

## The Mars Pattern (No Moon)
- **Asteroid Capture**: Capture a Phobos/Deimos-sized asteroid and move it to the L3 anchor point.
- **Depot Conversion**: Hollow out the asteroid for orbital storage and production, avoiding the cost of lifting mass from a planet.

## The Luna Pattern (Large Moon)
- **Refinery First**: Establish moon mining/refineries to "push" mass into orbit for the L1 Ship Construction station.
- **Operational Goal**: The AI builds the Colony (Phases 1 & 2) specifically to serve as the Factory for the Consortium's Network (Phase 3).

## The Venus Pattern (Inaccessible Surface)
- **Orbital Assembly**: Only when the surface is inaccessible does the AI import pre-fabricated components for orbital assembly and atmospheric skimming.

## Settlement as Network Infrastructure
The operational goal is to build settlements that serve the wormhole network, creating a self-sustaining economic ecosystem that reduces dependency on Earth imports.
