# Economic Priority System

## Priority Hierarchy

1. **Player Market (GCC)** - Always try players first
2. **NPC Trade (Virtual Ledger)** - If no players available
3. **Earth Import (USD)** - Last resort only

## AI Manager Decision Flow

AI Manager uses a data-driven decision flow to source materials, always prioritizing player engagement and self-sufficiency.

## Economic Intelligence

- **Buy Order Pricing**: Dynamic pricing based on market conditions
- **Timeout/Fallback Logic**: Automatic escalation through priority levels
- **Performance Tracking**: Metrics on self-sufficiency and player engagement

## GCC Currency System

- **Initial Coupling**: GCC coupled to USD to bootstrap lunar market
- **Decoupling**: Eventually becomes independent galactic currency
- **Market Dynamics**: Virtual ledger for NPC transactions, player-driven GCC economy
- **Minting Mechanism**: Lunar Currency Authority Satellite (LCAS) mints GCC at controlled rate for LDC resource budget
- **Dual Currency**: GCC for player transactions; USD restricted to NPC corp-to-corp use
- **Adoption Incentives**: LDC pays employees/contracts in GCC; offers subsidies/grants; provides exclusive access to services/resources
- **Governance**: LDC sets transaction fees, block rewards, staking rules; players may influence via reputation/actions
- **Security**: Integrated wallets with cybersecurity challenges; potential for hacks or fraud

## Hybrid Market System

- **Fixed Prices for Basics**: Essential goods (ammunition, basic repairs) sold at NPC vendors with stable prices
- **Player-Driven Advanced Market**: Rare/advanced goods traded via buy/sell orders with dynamic pricing
- **NPC Stabilizers**: LDC posts buy/sell orders to maintain price floors/ceilings, preventing extreme volatility

## GCC Faucets and Sinks

- **Faucets**: LDC mission payouts funded by LCAS-minted GCC; guaranteed buy orders for lunar resources
- **Sinks**: Reprocessing/manufacturing fees at LDC facilities; import duties for Earth goods; base upkeep costs
- **Import System**: Players request Earth imports via LDC, paying GCC; LDC uses USD reserves for procurement

## Consortium Integration

- **Transit Fees**: Revenue from wormhole usage
- **Dividends**: Returns to member corporations
- **Route Proposals**: Player voting on expansion priorities
