# AI Manager Intelligence & Memory Systems

## Survey Data Persistence

- **Wormhole Location Database**: Stores precise coordinates of detected natural wormholes for future artificial wormhole targeting
- **EM Signature Mapping**: Maintains historical EM detection data to identify EM-rich systems and track wormhole activity patterns
- **System Survey History**: Remembers detailed survey results to avoid redundant scanning and enable comparative analysis

## Strategic Memory Applications

- **Artificial Wormhole Planning**: Uses stored natural wormhole locations as target coordinates for artificial wormhole creation
- **EM Resource Assessment**: Prioritizes systems with residual EM signatures for network expansion opportunities
- **Network Optimization**: Leverages historical data to predict wormhole stability and optimize counterbalance station placement

## Data-Driven Intelligence Loop

- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies recurring EM signatures and wormhole behavior patterns across surveyed systems
- **Predictive Analysis**: Uses historical survey data to anticipate EM availability and wormhole stability in unexplored regions
- **Strategic Targeting**: Focuses expansion efforts on systems with proven EM potential or known wormhole locations

## AI Manager Performance Metrics

- **Self-Sufficiency**: Local production ratio, Earth import dependency, USD debt
- **Player Economy**: Engagement ratio, buy order fulfillment, active contracts
- **NPC Network**: Trade efficiency, Virtual Ledger utilization, specialization
- **Operational**: Stalled projects, shortages, construction queue idle time
