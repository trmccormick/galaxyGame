## Analysis Criteria Results

### Logistics Load Assessment
Escape velocity calculations compared to standard Titan-based He-3 freighter fuel consumption (baseline: ~2.5 km/s Δv for Earth-Mars transfer):

- **YQ-614284-P1**: 66.5 km/s - Extremely high fuel requirement (26x baseline)
- **VLYT-318729-P4**: 82.3 km/s - Critical fuel demand (33x baseline)
- **KTFD-18636-P3**: 70.5 km/s - Severe fuel requirement (28x baseline)

**Conclusion**: All candidates represent "hard targets" requiring specialized heavy-lift infrastructure.

### Resource Density Analysis
Density-to-mass ratio analysis (higher values indicate greater heavy metal/rare earth concentrations):

- **VLYT-318729-P4**: 34,330 kg/m³ - Superior resource concentration
- **YQ-614284-P1**: 31,971 kg/m³ - High but secondary
- **KTFD-18636-P3**: 19,793 kg/m³ - Moderate concentration

**Conclusion**: VLYT-318729 offers the richest mineral deposits.

### AI Decision Tree Prediction
With System A at 50% settlement completion, AI Manager prioritization logic:

1. **Phase 1 Priority**: Complete System A terraforming (ongoing)
2. **Phase 2 Priority**: Resource extraction for infrastructure expansion
3. **Phase 3 Priority**: Strategic heavy industry establishment

**AI Logic Flow**:
- System A (terraformable) → Settlement focus
- VLYT-318729 (high-density) → Heavy metal mining for advanced manufacturing
- YQ-614284 (high-gravity) → Potential future industrial hub
- KTFD-18636 (moderate) → Backup resource world

**Predicted AI Ranking**: VLYT-318729 > YQ-614284 > KTFD-18636

## Recommendation: System B - VLYT-318729

**Rationale**:
- Highest resource density indicates richest rare earth/heavy metal deposits
- Strategic positioning for Phase 3 heavy industry development
- Challenging but achievable with proper infrastructure investment
- Complements System A's terraforming focus with industrial capacity

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Sanitize identifiers: Rename PLANET-1 style IDs to VLYT-318729-b format
- Deploy specialized mining infrastructure for high-gravity operations
- Establish fuel depots for return trips from deep gravity well
- Integrate with AI Manager Phase 12 asteroid resource extraction protocols

**Risk Assessment**:
- High operational costs due to escape velocity
- Requires advanced materials technology for surface operations
- Cold temperatures may necessitate habitat pressurization upgrades

**Next Steps**:
1. Load VLYT-318729.json through procedural_generator.rb sanitization
2. Update AI Manager configuration for System B recognition
3. Develop specialized craft templates for high-gravity mining operations
4. Integrate with wormhole expansion Phase 6+ protocols
