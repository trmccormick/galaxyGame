# Institutional Framework: The Consortium

## Founders
Formed by AstroLift (Logistics & Ship Ops) and the LDC (Materials & Construction) to combine infrastructure building with long-haul transit.

## The Gamble
Member corporations (including players) fund the initial high-cost build by voting on Route Proposals.

## Dividends
Once operational, members receive dividends from transit fees and preferential logistical rates.

## Structure Ownership
The Consortium owns the Artificial Wormhole Stations (AWS), L1 Stations, and Depots; local settlements are users/customers.

## Consortium Role in Network
- **Artificial Wormhole Targeting**: Uses stored natural wormhole location data to precisely target artificial wormhole creation to known EM-rich locations
- **EM Opportunity Assessment**: Prioritizes systems with detected residual EM for artificial wormhole development
- **Network Management**: Manages wormhole network, Snap events, and economic decisions
- **Governance**: All logic is pattern-based and system-agnostic

## Economic Integration
The Consortium integrates with the broader economic system:
- Transit fees contribute to GCC economy
- Member voting influences expansion priorities
- Dividends provide ROI for corporate investments
- Player participation through Route Proposals
