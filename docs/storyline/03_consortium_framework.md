# Institutional Framework: The Wormhole Transit Consortium

## Founders
Formed by major logistics corporations (AstroLift, Zenith Orbital, Vector Hauling) and Development Corporations to combine transportation expertise with construction capabilities for long-haul transit infrastructure.

**Key Founding Members:**
- **Logistics Corporations**: Provide transportation, ship operations, and network management expertise
- **LDC (Lunar Development Corporation)**: The oldest and most developed DC, brings mature construction infrastructure essential for building Wormhole Stations and Artificial Wormhole Stations (AWS)
- **Other Development Corporations**: Contribute capital and participate in governance

## Founding Member Roles

**LDC's Critical Contribution:**
As the most established Development Corporation, LDC provides the construction expertise and infrastructure maturity required to build the physical wormhole network components. Their experience with large-scale space construction projects makes them indispensable for deploying AWS, L1 Stations, and Depots.

## The Gamble
Member corporations (including players) fund the initial high-cost build by voting on Route Proposals.

## Dividends
Once operational, members receive dividends from transit fees and preferential logistical rates.

## Structure Ownership
The Consortium owns the Artificial Wormhole Stations (AWS), L1 Stations, and Depots; local settlements are users/customers.

## Consortium Role in Network
- **Artificial Wormhole Targeting**: Uses stored natural wormhole location data to precisely target artificial wormhole creation to known EM-rich locations
- **EM Opportunity Assessment**: Prioritizes systems with detected residual EM for artificial wormhole development
- **Network Management**: Manages wormhole network, Snap events, and economic decisions
- **Governance**: All logic is pattern-based and system-agnostic

## Economic Integration
The Consortium integrates with the broader economic system:
- Transit fees contribute to GCC economy
- Member voting influences expansion priorities
- Dividends provide ROI for corporate investments
- Player participation through Route Proposals

## Post-Snap Evolution: TerraGen Terraforming Consortium

Following the initial snap events that opened access to multiple new systems, the Development Corporations formed TerraGen to coordinate terraforming efforts across the expanding network.

**Formation Trigger:** The snap event revealed numerous habitable worlds requiring coordinated terraforming expertise.

**Founding Members:**
- LDC and other established Development Corporations
- New system settlers seeking terraforming technology
- Corporations providing terraforming supplies and biological materials

**Complementary Role:** While the Wormhole Transit Consortium manages interstellar logistics, TerraGen focuses on making new worlds habitable, creating a symbiotic relationship between transportation infrastructure and colonization capabilities.
