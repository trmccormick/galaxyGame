- **Haumea**: Unique elongated shape, water ice resources
- **Makemake**: Large KBO with methane atmosphere
- **Sedna**: Distant object, potentially different composition

#### 6. **Trojan Asteroids**
- **Jupiter Trojans**: Large population of asteroids at L4/L5 points
- **Neptune Trojans**: Could be mining outposts
- **Game potential**: Stable mining locations, strategic positioning

#### 7. **Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs)**
- **Why interesting**: Accessible from Earth-Mars space, potential resources
- **Game potential**: Early mining targets, reduced delta-V requirements
- **Strategic value**: Bridge between inner planets and belt

#### 8. **Comet Nuclei**
- **Why interesting**: Volatile-rich, could be mobile resource depots
- **Game potential**: Water/CO2 sources, scientific research targets
- **Strategic value**: Mobile resource platforms

### Low-Priority but Interesting

#### 9. **Lagrange Points**
- **L4/L5 Points**: Could have permanent stations at stable locations
- **Game potential**: Strategic positioning, reduced station-keeping requirements

#### 10. **Heliosphere Boundary**
- **Why interesting**: Scientific research, solar wind monitoring
- **Game potential**: Early warning systems, fundamental research
- **Strategic value**: Represents true Solar System boundary exploration

## Portal Technology Integration & ROI Considerations

### Portal Tech Characteristics (Late Game)
**Universal Deployment**: Can be installed anywhere with EM power, working in matching pairs
**Hub Network System**: Functions like airports with connections to different hubs for transfers
**Inter-System Access**: Can connect to AWS stations for travel to other star systems
**Transit Replacement**: Replaces long hull transit and small cargo transfers

### Critical Clarification: Portal Tech = Inter-System Enablement
**Portals enable hub-based travel within and between star systems.** Late-game portal networks transform Solar System economics by providing airport-like connectivity.

### Pre-Portal Economics (Early/Mid Game)
**Distance = Cost**: High delta-V requirements penalize distant locations
- **NEAs**: Low delta-V, high accessibility, excellent ROI
- **Mars Belt**: Moderate delta-V, established infrastructure, solid ROI
- **Jupiter Trojans**: High delta-V but stable positions, moderate ROI
- **Pluto/Kuiper Belt**: Extreme delta-V, permanently poor ROI

### Post-Portal Economics (Late Game)
**Hub network connectivity dramatically improves ROI for distant locations**
- **NEAs**: Excellent ROI maintained, becomes major hub for inner system transfers
- **Mars Belt**: Strong ROI enhanced, strategic hub positioning
- **Jupiter Trojans**: High ROI for stable L4/L5 hub locations
- **Pluto/Kuiper Belt**: Strong ROI through AWS connections and frontier research value

### Portal Network Impact
**Airport-style connectivity enables efficient transfers:**
- **Personnel Transport**: Rapid deployment across Solar System
- **Small Cargo**: High-value material transfers
- **Hub Connections**: Transfer points for inter-system travel via AWS
- **Emergency Response**: Crisis intervention capabilities and ship-based evacuations
- **Research Collaboration**: Real-time coordination across sites
- **Fleet Operations**: Crew rotation and emergency transport from ships to home bases
- **Bulk Transport**: Cycler craft still required for large assets, terraforming resources, and industrial equipment

## Updated Development Priority (Portal Tech Progression)

### Phase 1-5: Pre-Portal Optimization
1. **NEAs** - Excellent ROI, low delta-V, early accessibility
2. **Vesta** - Strong ROI, inner belt position, research value
3. **Solar Monitoring** - Essential safety infrastructure

### Phase 6-10: Mid-Game Expansion
4. **Pallas** - Good ROI for specialty materials
5. **Jupiter Trojans** - Moderate ROI, strategic positioning

### Phase 11-15: Portal Network Development
6. **Pluto System** - Poor pre-portal ROI → Strong post-portal ROI through AWS connections
7. **Portal Hub Establishment** - Key locations become transfer points

### Phase 15+: Portal Era Opportunities
- **Kuiper Belt Objects** - Frontier research with hub connectivity
- **Oort Cloud** - Ultimate exploration (very long-term)
- **Inter-System Trade Routes** - Solar System locations as gateway hubs
- **Portal Network Optimization** - Strategic hub placement for maximum connectivity

### Phase 20+: Dynamic Portal Networks (Research Breakthrough)
**EM-Constrained Expansion**: Removal of pairing requirement enables dynamic connectivity, but EM budget limits network scale
- **Energy-Driven Strategy**: Portal deployment determined by EM availability rather than distance
- **Strategic Rebalancing**: EM-rich locations gain disproportionate value through network centrality
- **Exploration Challenge**: New gameplay around energy management and competitive EM markets

**Location Reassessment**:
- **Active Wormhole Control**: AI can maintain temporary access or force shifts for strategic scouting
- **Inter-System Wormhole Assets**: Natural wormholes in other systems become high-value strategic targets
- **Natural Wormhole Priority**: Systems with active EM-expelling wormholes get preferential stabilization investment
- **Local Bubble Cost Assessment**: Artificial connections require higher EM justification without natural EM sources
- **ROI-Driven Access**: Portal connectivity requires proving EM investment value over alternatives
- **Wormhole Harvesting Strategy**: Temporary resource extraction from natural wormholes vs permanent investment
- **EM Resource Priority**: Locations with abundant EM generation become portal network hubs
- **High-Value Focus**: Inner system and major trade routes prioritized over marginal distant sites
- **AWS Competition**: EM allocation decisions between wormhole stations and portal networks
- **Network Monopoly**: Corporations controlling EM resources dominate portal connectivity

## Integration Opportunities

- **Belt Mining Network**: Vesta/Pallas would expand Ceres-Psyche coordination
- **Resource Diversity**: Different asteroid types provide varied economic opportunities
- **Exploration Narrative**: Pluto represents "leaving the Solar System" milestone
- **Power Infrastructure**: Solar operations enable sustainable energy throughout system
