# 16 Psyche Mining Site Integration

## Overview
Add 16 Psyche as a premier mining site in the Sol system's asteroid belt, leveraging real astronomical data for authentic gameplay.

## Scientific Basis
- **Type**: M-type metallic asteroid
- **Diameter**: 220 km (mean)
- **Mass**: 2.29 × 10^19 kg
- **Density**: 3.98 g/cm³ (indicating high metal content)
- **Composition**: Primarily iron-nickel core material, potentially exposed planetary core
- **Location**: Asteroid belt (2.53-3.32 AU from Sol)
- **Orbital Period**: 4.998 years

## Game Integration Requirements

### Resource Profile
- **Primary Resources**:
  - Iron: High concentration (estimated 70-90%)
  - Nickel: Significant amounts (5-15%)
  - Other metals: Cobalt, platinum group metals
- **Resource Quality**: Exceptional purity due to being exposed core material
- **Extraction Difficulty**: Moderate (large size allows multiple sites, but requires heavy mining equipment)

### Strategic Value
- **Industrial Importance**: Critical for ship construction, infrastructure, and manufacturing
- **Economic Impact**: High-value trading hub potential
- **Colony Potential**: Surface mining operations, processing facilities
- **Research Value**: Scientific study site (NASA mission reference)

### Gameplay Features
- **Mining Operations**: Multiple extraction sites possible due to size
- **Processing Facilities**: On-site smelting and refining
- **Transportation Hubs**: Key location for asteroid belt logistics
- **Security Concerns**: High-value target for piracy/defense missions
- **Expansion Opportunities**: Industrial complex development

## Implementation Steps
1. Add 16 Psyche to Sol system celestial bodies
2. Define resource composition and extraction parameters
3. Create mining mission templates
4. Implement economic balancing for metal markets
5. Add visual representation and navigation data
