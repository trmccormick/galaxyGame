# Update Biosphere Documentation with Phosphorus Mechanics

## Problem
Current biosphere documentation lacks scientific grounding from recent research on phosphorus as a critical element for life. The February 2026 Nature Astronomy study identifies phosphorus availability as a "Great Filter" for natural biospheres and a key bottleneck for engineered ones.

## Current State
- `architecture/biosphere_system.md` covers general life support and ecosystems
- No specific mechanics for phosphorus requirements or atmospheric vs. biological terraforming distinctions
- Missing quantification of P needs for population support
- Worldhouse concepts exist but lack P-focused implementation details

## Required Changes

### Phase 1: Research Integration
Add scientific foundation from recent studies:
- Phosphorus as energy currency (ATP) and DNA backbone
- Earth's "chemical fluke" during core formation
- Mars paradox: high P abundance but locked in minerals
- Population P requirements: ~15-20k tons bio-available P for 1M people

### Phase 2: Mechanical Distinctions
Document atmospheric vs. biological terraforming:
- Atmospheric: N2/O2/CO2 balance (solved by Reflector + Skimmers)
- Biological: P/N balance for DNA and food chains (requires imports/refining)
- Worldhouse as "terraforming seed" with concentrated P nutrients

### Phase 3: Resource Hierarchy
Define P sources and processing:
- Native Mars: High concentration but locked (apatite/merrillite)
- Ceres/Belt: Accessible apatite for fertilizer
- Psyche-like cores: Concentrated metallic P (schreibersite)
- Phobos/Deimos stations: Refining role for bio-available P

### Phase 4: AI Manager Integration
Update scouting and logistics sections:
- P-triage for system evaluation (Eden vs. Project worlds)
- Supply chain requirements for engineered biospheres
- Population caps tied to P reserves

## Success Criteria
- Biosphere docs include P mechanics with scientific citations
- Clear distinction between atmospheric and biological terraforming
- Resource hierarchy table with sources and roles
- AI Manager implications documented
- No conflicts with existing atmospheric maintenance docs

## Dependencies
- Access to `architecture/biosphere_system.md`
- Reference to atmospheric maintenance system
- AI Manager documentation for cross-linking

## Priority
Medium - Enhances scientific accuracy and gameplay depth without blocking current development.</content>
