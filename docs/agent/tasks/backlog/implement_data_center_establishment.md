# Implement Data Center Establishment in New Systems

## Problem
The expanding wormhole network requires strategic infrastructure placement to maintain connectivity, logistics, and control. Data Centers (DC) serve as critical hubs for communication, resource distribution, and system administration in newly established systems.

## Current State
- **No Infrastructure Planning**: Missing strategic placement of support infrastructure
- **Communication Gaps**: Wormhole network lacks relay and control points
- **Logistics Bottlenecks**: No distribution hubs for resource flow
- **Administrative Vacuum**: New systems lack governance and control infrastructure

## Required Changes

### Task 4.1: Design Data Center Infrastructure Framework
- Define DC types (Communication Hub, Resource Distribution Center, Administrative Center)
- Create DC establishment requirements and costs
- Implement DC strategic placement algorithms
- Add DC network connectivity and coverage calculations

### Task 4.2: Implement DC Establishment Mechanics
- Build DC construction and activation process
- Create DC upgrade and specialization paths
- Implement DC maintenance and resource requirements
- Add DC failure and recovery scenarios

### Task 4.3: Integrate DC with Wormhole Network
- Create DC as wormhole network nodes and relays
- Implement network stability calculations based on DC placement
- Add DC-based communication range and latency systems
- Build DC network optimization for expansion routes

### Task 4.4: Develop DC AI Management
- Implement AI DC placement decision making
- Add DC network strategic planning
- Create DC resource allocation optimization
- Integrate DC management with expansion goals

## Success Criteria
- Strategic DC placement supports wormhole network expansion
- DC network provides communication and logistics backbone
- AI can autonomously establish and manage DCs
- DC infrastructure enables sustainable system expansion

## Files to Create/Modify
- `galaxy_game/app/models/data_center.rb` (new)
- `galaxy_game/app/services/data_center_establishment_service.rb` (new)
- `galaxy_game/app/services/wormhole_network_manager.rb` (enhance)
- `galaxy_game/spec/models/data_center_spec.rb` (new)

## Testing Requirements
- Test DC establishment in various system configurations
- Validate network connectivity improvements
- Test AI DC placement decisions
- Verify DC resource and maintenance systems

## Dependencies
- Requires wormhole network system
- Assumes celestial body database
- Needs economic and construction systems

## Notes
- Clarify if "DC" refers to Data Centers, Distribution Centers, or another infrastructure type
- Consider integration with existing colony and foothold systems</content>
