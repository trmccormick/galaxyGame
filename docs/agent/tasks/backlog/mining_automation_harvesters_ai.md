# Mining Automation: Harvesters & AI Management
**Date:** February 14, 2026
**Context:** Addressing EVE's mining grind through intelligent automation
**Focus:** Player-built harvesters managed by AI systems for sustainable resource extraction

## 🎯 The Mining Grind Problem

### **EVE's Mining Reality**
**Manual Repetition**: Players spend hours watching mining lasers cycle on asteroids, making binary decisions about what to target next.

**Time Investment**: "Efficient" mining requires 4-8 hour sessions of repetitive clicking and watching progress bars.

**No Meaningful Decisions**: Mining becomes a passive activity where the only "skill" is fitting the right ship and clicking the right buttons.

**Burnout Factor**: Mining sessions feel like work, not gameplay - leading to the infamous "mining is the worst part of EVE" sentiment.

### **Your Solution: Build & Automate**
**Player Role**: Design, build, and deploy specialized harvesters
**AI Role**: Manage the actual extraction process autonomously
**Player Benefit**: Set up sustainable operations, then focus on higher-level strategy
