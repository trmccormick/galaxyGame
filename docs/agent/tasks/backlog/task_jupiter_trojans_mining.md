# Jupiter Trojan Asteroid Mining

## Overview
Establish mining operations in the Jupiter Trojan asteroids, leveraging their stable L4/L5 positions for long-term resource extraction and strategic positioning.

## Scientific Basis
- **Location**: Two large swarms at Jupiter's L4 and L5 Lagrange points (5.2 AU)
- **Population**: Thousands of asteroids, some over 100km diameter
- **Stability**: Gravitationally stable positions, minimal station-keeping required
- **Composition**: Mix of C, P, and D-type asteroids with various resources

## Game Integration
**Role**: Stable, long-term mining platforms
- **Resources**: Water ice, organics, metals depending on asteroid type
- **Positioning**: Strategic locations along major Solar System trade routes
- **Specialization**: Permanent mining outposts with minimal orbital maintenance

## Mission Structure (Following Ceres Pattern)
1. **Survey Operations** - Catalog Trojan population and assess resources
2. **High-Value Selection** - Identify optimal asteroids for development
3. **Mining Establishment** - Deploy extraction facilities on selected targets
4. **Logistics Integration** - Connect to Jupiter and outer planet trade routes

## Strategic Value
- **Stability Advantage**: No orbital decay, permanent settlements possible
- **Route Control**: Strategic positioning on major transportation corridors
- **Resource Diversity**: Different compositions provide varied economic opportunities
- **Expansion Platform**: Gateway for further outer Solar System development
- **Fleet Support**: Portal-enabled emergency transport and crew welfare for outer system operations

## ROI Considerations
- **Pre-Portal**: Moderate ROI due to distance but stable positioning compensates
- **Post-Portal**: High ROI for strategic hub locations and stable L4/L5 positioning
- **Development Timeline**: Phase 8-12 implementation (post-Jupiter system development)
- **Economic Model**: Long-term mining with strategic hub positioning value

## Integration Points
- **Jupiter System**: Coordination with Jupiter orbital hub operations
- **Outer Planets**: Supply chain for Saturn/Uranus/Neptune missions
- **Trade Routes**: Control key positions on cycler routes
- **Research Value**: Study of primitive Solar System materials

## Success Criteria
- Establish sustainable Trojan mining operations
- Create strategic trade route advantages
- Provide stable, long-term resource extraction
- Enable outer Solar System expansion pathways</content>
