# Near-Earth Asteroid Mining Network

## Overview
Develop a network of Near-Earth Asteroid (NEA) mining operations, providing accessible resources for inner Solar System development with reduced delta-V requirements.

## Scientific Basis
- **Location**: Orbits crossing Earth's path (0.8-1.3 AU from Sun)
- **Types**: Various compositions - stony, metallic, carbonaceous
- **Accessibility**: Low delta-V requirements compared to main belt asteroids
- **Resources**: Metals, water ice, rare materials depending on asteroid type

## Game Integration
**Role**: Accessible mining targets for early/intermediate gameplay
- **Resources**: Variety of materials based on asteroid composition
- **Positioning**: Bridge between inner planets and main belt operations
- **Specialization**: High-frequency, lower-risk mining operations

## Mission Structure (Following Ceres Pattern)
1. **Survey Network** - Catalog and assess accessible NEAs
2. **High-Value Targets** - Prioritize metallic/water-rich asteroids
3. **Mining Operations** - Establish extraction facilities on select targets
4. **Logistics Network** - Transport systems to inner planets

## Strategic Value
- **Early Access**: Resources available without main belt infrastructure
- **Risk Reduction**: Lower delta-V means safer, more frequent operations
- **Economic Bridge**: Connects inner planet economies to asteroid resources
- **Technology Testing**: Platform for developing asteroid mining techniques

## ROI Considerations
- **Pre-Portal**: Excellent ROI due to proximity to Earth markets
- **Post-Portal**: Excellent ROI enhanced as major hub for inner system transfers
- **Development Timeline**: Phase 3-8 implementation (early expansion)
- **Economic Model**: High-frequency operations with hub connectivity advantages

## Integration Points
- **Inner Planets**: Direct supply to Earth, Mars, Venus operations
- **Belt Coordination**: Complements Ceres/Psyche main belt operations
- **Research Value**: Test mining technologies before main belt deployment
- **Economic Impact**: Stabilizes inner system resource markets

## Success Criteria
- Establish viable NEA mining operations
- Create accessible resource gameplay for early players
- Develop efficient inner system logistics
- Provide foundation for main belt expansion</content>
