# 2 Pallas Mining Settlement

## Overview
Develop 2 Pallas as a specialized asteroid belt mining settlement focusing on rare earth elements and organic compounds, complementing Ceres (water/ice) and Psyche (metals) with unique B-type asteroid resources.

## Scientific Basis
- **Type**: B-type asteroid, possibly aqueously altered carbonaceous chondrite
- **Diameter**: ~510 km (third largest asteroid)
- **Composition**: Likely contains water, organic compounds, rare earth elements
- **Features**: Oblate spheroid shape, potential for subsurface water/organics
- **Location**: Main asteroid belt (2.12-3.41 AU)

## Game Integration
**Role**: Rare materials and organic compound extraction hub
- **Resources**: Rare earth elements, organic compounds, potential water ice
- **Positioning**: Main belt location, accessible from Ceres coordination network
- **Specialization**: High-value specialty materials vs bulk resources

## Mission Structure (Following Ceres Pattern)
1. **Resource Survey** - Map organic/rare earth deposits
2. **Water Ice Extraction** - Extract any subsurface water resources
3. **Rare Earth Mining** - Specialized extraction of valuable elements
4. **Belt Coordination** - Integration with Ceres/AstroLift network

## Integration with Belt Network
- **Trade Partners**: Ceres Development Corporation, Mars Development Corporation
- **Specialization**: High-value specialty materials complementing Ceres/Psyche bulk resources
- **Transport**: Main belt position enables efficient inter-belt logistics

## ROI Considerations
- **Pre-Portal**: Good ROI for specialty materials, moderate distance penalty
- **Post-Portal**: Strong ROI maintained due to unique resource profile and hub positioning
- **Development Timeline**: Phase 6-10 implementation (post-Ceres expansion)
- **Economic Model**: Specialty mining with premium pricing and transfer hub value

## Success Criteria
- Establish Pallas as viable specialty mining site
- Create economic incentives for rare material extraction
- Provide high-value resource gameplay opportunities
- Complete the "Big Three" asteroid belt settlements</content>
