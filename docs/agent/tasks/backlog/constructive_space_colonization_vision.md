# Galaxy Game: Constructive Space Colonization Vision
**Date:** February 14, 2026
**Context:** Establishing PvE-focused, cooperative space colonization vs EVE's PvP-centric model
**Vision:** Humanity's future as builders and explorers, not warriors and destroyers

## 🌟 Core Vision: Peaceful Galactic Expansion

### **Rejecting EVE's PvP-Centric Model**
**EVE Online's Reality**: A game where CCP celebrates "ships destroyed per hour" as their primary metric, creating a universe defined by conflict, piracy, and destruction.

**Galaxy Game's Reality**: A universe defined by creation, exploration, cooperation, and sustainable expansion - where the primary metrics are colonies established, systems explored, trade networks built, and knowledge advanced.

### **Humanity's Realistic Future**
**Not**: Endless warfare between corporate factions destroying each other's ships
**But**: Collaborative expansion into the stars, building new homes, establishing trade routes, and advancing scientific understanding for the benefit of all humanity.

## 🏗️ Constructive Gameplay Focus

### **Primary Activities (90%+ of Content)**
