# 4 Vesta Mining Settlement

## Overview
Develop 4 Vesta as the third major asteroid belt mining settlement, complementing Ceres (water/ice) and Psyche (metals) with basaltic resources and scientific research opportunities.

## Scientific Basis
- **Type**: V-type asteroid, likely differentiated basaltic achondrite
- **Diameter**: ~530 km (largest after Ceres)
- **Composition**: Basaltic surface, potential mantle material exposure
- **Features**: Rheasilvia crater (bottomless pit), massive south pole impact basin
- **Location**: Inner asteroid belt (2.15-2.57 AU)

## Game Integration
**Role**: Basaltic mining and research hub
- **Resources**: Basaltic rock, potential rare earth elements, scientific samples
- **Positioning**: Inner belt location closer to Mars than Ceres/Psyche
- **Specialization**: Research and high-value material extraction

## Mission Structure
1. **Orbital Survey** - Map basaltic composition and crater features
2. **Surface Research** - Study Rheasilvia crater and geological features  
3. **Mining Operations** - Extract basaltic materials for construction/research
4. **Research Complex** - Planetary science and material research facilities

## Integration with Belt Network
- **Trade Partners**: Mars Development Corporation (closer proximity), Ceres Development Corporation
- **Specialization**: High-value research materials vs Ceres water/Psyche metals
- **Transport**: Inner belt position enables efficient Mars access

## ROI Considerations
- **Pre-Wormhole**: Strong ROI due to inner belt position and research value
- **Post-Portal**: Strong ROI enhanced for scientific research and hub positioning
- **Development Timeline**: Phase 5-9 implementation (follows Ceres)
- **Economic Model**: Research-driven mining with premium for scientific samples and transfers

## Success Criteria
- Establish Vesta as viable research/mining site
- Create economic incentives for inner belt operations
- Provide scientific/research gameplay opportunities
- Complete the "Big Three" asteroid belt settlements</content>
