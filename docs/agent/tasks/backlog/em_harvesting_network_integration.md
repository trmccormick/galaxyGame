# EM Harvesting Network Integration

## Task Overview
Implement the Exotic Matter (EM) harvesting and distribution network where natural wormholes become power sources for artificial wormhole stations, creating a galactic energy economy.

## Background
Natural wormholes release EM when they collapse or "snap." This energy can be harvested to power artificial wormhole stations, creating a symbiotic relationship between natural and artificial wormhole technologies.

## Requirements

### Phase 1: EM Harvesting Infrastructure (Priority: High)
**Stabilization Satellites:**
- **Harvest Mode**: Siphon EM from collapsed natural wormholes
- **Logistics Mode**: Receive and distribute EM from Sol
- **Storage Capacity**: EM vault construction and management

**EM Generation Sources:**
- Natural wormhole collapses ("Hot Starts")
- Spatial tension from mass transit
- Residual blooms from "Snaps"
- Artificial generation through AWS operations

### Phase 2: Network Distribution System (Priority: High)
**EM Economy:**
- EM as currency for wormhole maintenance
- Storage vault construction at key nodes
- Inter-system EM transfer protocols

**Power Grid Integration:**
- EM conversion to usable energy
- Backup power for critical systems
- Emergency EM reserves for stabilization

**AWS Dependency Chain:**
- Natural wormholes provide EM for artificial stations
- Artificial stations stabilize natural wormholes
- Self-sustaining energy loop creation

### Phase 3: Counterbalance Engineering (Priority: Medium)
**Gravitational Anchoring:**
- 180° opposite placement calculations
- Mass-equivalent requirements for stability
- Artificial counterweight deployment

**Stability Monitoring:**
- Tension meters for wormhole health
- Early warning systems for impending snaps
- Emergency stabilization protocols

### Phase 4: Economic Integration (Priority: Medium)
**GCC/EM Exchange Rates:**
- EM harvesting profitability calculations
- Maintenance cost offsets
- Market volatility from wormhole events

**Resource Allocation:**
- EM harvesting priority decisions
- Network expansion planning
- Risk assessment for EM-dependent systems

## Success Criteria
- EM harvesting provides sustainable power for wormhole networks
- Natural/artificial wormhole symbiosis functions correctly
- Counterbalance physics prevent unwanted snaps
- Economic benefits justify EM infrastructure investment

## Dependencies
- Existing wormhole system architecture
- Economic engine (GCC calculations)
- AI Manager decision framework
- Stabilization satellite models

## Files to Create/Modify
- `app/services/em_harvesting_service.rb`
- `app/services/wormhole_stability_monitor.rb`
- `app/models/em_vault.rb`
- `app/services/ai_manager/em_economy_planner.rb`
- JSON schemas for EM storage and transfer
- Update wormhole models with EM integration

## Testing Requirements
- EM harvesting simulation tests
- Network distribution efficiency tests
- Counterbalance stability tests
- Economic integration tests

## Documentation Updates
- Expand wormhole system documentation
- Add EM harvesting operational procedures
- Document counterbalance engineering requirements
- Create network maintenance guidelines

## Timeline
- Phase 1: 2 weeks (harvesting infrastructure)
- Phase 2: 3 weeks (network distribution)
- Phase 3: 2 weeks (counterbalance engineering)
- Phase 4: 2 weeks (economic integration)

## Risk Assessment
- **High**: Complex EM economy balancing
- **Medium**: Counterbalance physics implementation
- **Low**: Building on existing wormhole infrastructure

## Success Metrics
- EM harvesting offsets wormhole maintenance costs
- Network provides reliable power distribution
- Counterbalance engineering prevents snaps
- Economic benefits drive network expansion</content>
