# TerraGen Consortium & Eden System Integration

**Priority:** LOW (Post-MVP - Advanced Expansion Phase)
**Estimated Time:** 20-30 hours
**Risk Level:** HIGH (Complex multi-system coordination)
**Dependencies:** AI Manager autonomous expansion operational, wormhole network stable, multiple systems accessible

## 🎯 Objective
Implement TerraGen consortium formation detection and Eden system prioritization to enable advanced AI-driven multi-system expansion and coordinated terraforming efforts.

## 📋 Requirements

### TerraGen Consortium Integration
- **Formation Detection**: AI recognition of post-snap consortium formation triggers
- **Shared Resource Pools**: Multi-corporation resource coordination and allocation
- **Cooperative Missions**: Pre-hammer resource window harvesting missions
- **Terraforming Coordination**: Cross-corporation planetary modification planning

### Eden System Prioritization
- **Superior Target Detection**: Identify planets with better terraforming potential than Earth
- **Predictable Training**: Use generated Eden system for AI pattern development and testing
- **Strategic Focus Shift**: AI Manager prioritizes Eden planets when TerraGen active
- **Pattern Validation**: Test learned Sol patterns against new system challenges

### Inter-System Coordination
- **Resource Flow Optimization**: Multi-system logistics and trade automation
- **Economic Balancing**: Cross-system wealth distribution and opportunity optimization
- **Network Strategy**: Wormhole-based expansion corridor optimization
- **Institutional Adaptation**: AI learning from new economic/political structures

## 🔍 Analysis Phase

### Current System Architecture
- **Sol-Centric Design**: All current AI logic assumes Sol system operations
- **Single System Focus**: No cross-system resource allocation or coordination
- **Institutional Static**: AI doesn't adapt to consortium formation or new structures

### TerraGen Formation Triggers
- **Snap Events**: Wormhole shifts opening new systems
- **Infrastructure Milestones**: Local infrastructure enables mass cycler fleets
- **Corporate Coordination**: Development Corporations form consortium
- **Mission Integration**: Kinetic hammer planning with resource window opportunities

### Eden System Characteristics
- **Generated System**: AOL-732356 with predictable but new challenges
- **Quality Benchmark**: Must have superior terraforming targets vs Earth
- **Training Environment**: Controlled testing ground for AI expansion patterns
- **Progressive Complexity**: Bridge from known Sol to unknown generated systems

## 🛠️ Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Consortium Detection (8-10 hours)
- Add consortium formation event detection
- Implement shared resource pool management
- Create cooperative mission generation
- Add pre-hammer resource harvesting logic

### Phase 2: Eden System Integration (6-8 hours)
- Add Eden system recognition and metadata loading
- Implement terraforming quality assessment algorithms
- Create Eden-specific expansion prioritization
- Add pattern validation against new system challenges

### Phase 3: Multi-System Coordination (6-8 hours)
- Implement cross-system resource flow optimization
- Add inter-settlement automated trade
- Create system-wide economic balancing
- Integrate wormhole logistics optimization
