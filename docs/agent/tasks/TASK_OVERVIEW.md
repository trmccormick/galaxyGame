## Recent Architectural Decisions

### NASA Data Integration Strategy (2026-02-10)
**Decision**: Use NASA GeoTIFFs as ground truth for Sol bodies, patterns for exoplanets

**Rationale**:
- Real data provides highest quality visualization
- Patterns allow procedural generation for exoplanets
- Civ4 landmass shapes give Earth-like continents to exoplanets

**Implementation**: Completed in planetary_map_generator.rb

---

### System-Centric Dashboard Navigation (2026-02-10)
**Decision**: Reorganize admin dashboard around solar systems, not celestial body types

**Rationale**:
- More intuitive hierarchy: Galaxy → System → Bodies
- Scalable for multiple star systems
- Matches user mental model of exploration

**Implementation**: Completed in admin views and controllers

## Performance Metrics

### Terrain Generation
- **Target**: < 30 seconds per planet
- **Current**: Unknown (blocked by seeding issue)
- **Measurement**: Time from request to canvas render

### Database Seeding
- **Target**: < 60 seconds for complete Sol system
- **Current**: ~30 seconds but creates wrong types
- **Measurement**: `rails db:seed` execution time

### Monitor View Load
- **Target**: < 3 seconds first render
- **Current**: Requires refresh (timing issue)
- **Measurement**: Time from page load to canvas display

**Summary**: Mars surface view renders grey instead of rust red shown in monitor.
Investigation: Review biome color data pipeline between monitor view and surface view renderer.
**Reference**: backlog/surface_view_mars_color_mismatch.md

### Surface Map Initial Load Requires Refresh (2026-03-04)
**Status**: Backlog
**Summary**: Surface map requires manual browser refresh before tiles render on first load.
**Investigation**: Likely a JavaScript load order or DOM ready issue.
**Reference**: backlog/surface_map_initial_load.md

### EscalationService Redesign — ISRU-First Architecture (2026-03-05)
**Status**: Backlog
**Priority**: High
**Owner**: Unassigned — Claude Sonnet recommended (complex reasoning required)
**Created**: 2026-03-05

**Summary**: Current EscalationService does not reflect ISRU-first design principles. `critical_resource?` method is incorrect — oxygen/water are always harvested locally. `find_nearby_settlements` requires Cycler route network architecture before implementation.

**Correct escalation order:**
1. ISRU chain expansion — can local production meet demand
2. Deploy robot fleet for additional local harvesting
3. Query same-world settlements with available craft for in-system trade
4. Schedule import on next Cycler visit via established route
