# Galaxy Game - Core Mechanics

## Game Overview

Galaxy Game is a space colonization simulation where players establish and manage interplanetary infrastructure. The game focuses on resource management, technological advancement, and economic optimization across multiple celestial bodies.

## Core Game Loop

### 1. Exploration Phase
- **Orbital Survey**: Initial reconnaissance of planetary systems
- **Resource Assessment**: Identify valuable materials and extraction opportunities
- **Site Selection**: Choose optimal locations for infrastructure development

### 2. Infrastructure Development
- **Orbital Stations**: Establish processing and manufacturing capabilities
- **Surface Bases**: Construct permanent settlements and mining operations
- **Transportation Networks**: Build cyclers and depots for interplanetary logistics

### 3. Resource Management
- **Extraction**: Harvest raw materials from planetary surfaces and atmospheres
- **Processing**: Convert raw materials into usable products
- **Trade**: Buy/sell resources in interplanetary markets

### 4. Expansion
- **New Colonies**: Establish operations on additional celestial bodies
- **Technology Advancement**: Unlock new equipment and capabilities
- **Economic Optimization**: Maximize profit through efficient operations

## Key Systems

### Planetary Terraforming

Each planet has multiple spheres that can be modified:

- **Atmosphere**: Composition changes affect climate and habitability
- **Hydrosphere**: Water distribution and purification
- **Geosphere**: Surface modification and resource accessibility
- **Biosphere**: Introduction of Earth life forms

Terraforming requires:
- Energy input (solar, nuclear, or beamed power)
- Material resources for construction
- Time for natural processes to take effect

### Economic Engine

#### Resource Markets
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Supply and demand affect resource values
- **Interplanetary Trade**: Transport costs and time delays
- **Market Manipulation**: Players can influence prices through bulk transactions

#### Production Chains
- **Raw Materials**: Extracted from planetary surfaces
- **Processed Goods**: Manufactured in orbital facilities
- **Finished Products**: Used for construction and trade

### AI Management

The AI Manager handles:
- **Automated Missions**: Pre-planned colonization sequences
- **Resource Allocation**: Optimal distribution of equipment
- **Crisis Response**: Emergency resource deployment
- **Pattern Learning**: Improvement through successful operations
