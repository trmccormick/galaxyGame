# GCC Coupling Status

## Overview
This document tracks the current GCC (Galaxy Credit Currency) coupling status across all colonized systems, including exchange rates, market conditions, and economic indicators.

## System Exchange Rates

### SOL System (Solar System)
- **GCC/USD Base Rate**: 1.0 (stable parity)
- **Market Status**: Mature economy
- **Key Indicators**:
  - Wormhole Tax Rate: 0.8 (80% of standard)
  - Transport Cost Modifier: 1.0 (baseline)
  - Infrastructure Cost Modifier: 1.0 (baseline)
- **Resource Status**:
  - Helium-3: Abundant (lunar mining operations)
  - Silicates: Stable (asteroid belt mining)
  - Rare Earth Metals: High demand

### AOL System (Alpha Orionis)
- **GCC/USD Base Rate**: 1.0 (stable parity)
- **Market Status**: Developing economy
- **Key Indicators**:
  - Wormhole Tax Rate: 0.7 (70% of standard)
  - Transport Cost Modifier: 1.1 (+10% due to distance)
  - Infrastructure Cost Modifier: 1.2 (+20% due to remoteness)
- **Resource Status**:
  - Helium-3: Emerging (initial harvesting)
  - Silicates: Abundant (volcanic activity)
  - Rare Earth Metals: Low (limited deposits)

### AC System (Alpha Centauri)
- **GCC/USD Base Rate**: 1.0 (newly initialized parity)
- **Market Status**: Bootstrap economy (post-Super-Mars Relocation)
- **Key Indicators**:
  - Wormhole Tax Rate: 0.6 (60% of standard, optimized STE ratio)
  - Transport Cost Modifier: 0.9 (-10% slag propulsion efficiency)
  - Infrastructure Cost Modifier: 0.8 (-20% orbital depot leverage)
- **Resource Status**:
  - Helium-3: Low (planetary harvesting pending)
  - Silicates: Abundant (3 hollowed Phobos-class asteroids)
  - Slag Fuel: Emerging (asteroid hollowing byproduct)
  - Nuclear Fuel: Stable (L1 depot fusion reactors)

## Market Coupling Logic

### GCC Stability Mechanism
- **Anchor Currency**: USD (United States Dollar)
- **Coupling Method**: Direct parity maintenance
- **Adjustment Triggers**: Major economic events, resource discoveries, infrastructure completions

### System-Specific Modifiers
- **SOL**: Baseline economy, no modifiers
- **AOL**: Distance penalties, remoteness costs
- **AC**: Efficiency bonuses from advanced propulsion and orbital infrastructure

## Recent Updates

### 2026-01-15: AC-B1 Market Initialization
- Triggered by Super-Mars Relocation AC-B1 mission completion
- Established GCC/USD parity for Alpha Centauri system
- Set Silicate Supply to Abundant due to asteroid hollowing operations
- Set Helium-3 Supply to Low pending planetary harvesting
- Implemented 40% wormhole tax reduction through STE ratio optimization

## Economic Forecasting

### Short-term (2026 Q1)
- AC system: Continued bootstrap phase, focus on orbital infrastructure
- SOL system: Stable growth, lunar mining expansion
- AOL system: Infrastructure development, transport cost optimization

### Long-term (2026-2030)
- AC system: Transition to mature economy with planetary operations
- Inter-system trade volume increase: +150% projected
- GCC stability: Maintained through automated coupling mechanisms
