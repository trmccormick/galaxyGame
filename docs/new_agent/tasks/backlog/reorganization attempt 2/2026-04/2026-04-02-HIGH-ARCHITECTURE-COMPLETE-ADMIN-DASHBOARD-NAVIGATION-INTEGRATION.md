# Complete Admin Dashboard Navigation Integration

## Problem
The admin dashboard redesign has Phase 4 "Navigation Integration" marked as "IN PROGRESS" but the specific implementation steps are not clearly defined in tasks.

## Current State
- Phase 1-3: ✅ COMPLETED (Planning, Controller, View Structure)
- Phase 4: 🔄 IN PROGRESS (Navigation Integration)
- Phase 5: 📋 PENDING (Testing & Validation)

## Unclear Requirements from Documentation
The admin dashboard redesign document lists Phase 4 requirements but they need to be broken down into specific, actionable tasks:

1. **Update navigation links to use new structure** - Unclear which links and how
2. **Add system-specific monitoring links** - Not specified what these should be
3. **Implement galaxy switching persistence** - No technical details provided
4. **Add breadcrumb navigation** - Design not specified

## Required Changes
**Create Specific Tasks for Phase 4:**

### Task 4.1: Update Navigation Links
- Identify all navigation links in admin dashboard that reference old flat structure
- Update links to use hierarchical Galaxy → Star System → Celestial Body structure
- Ensure backward compatibility for existing URLs

### Task 4.2: System-Specific Monitoring Links
- Add quick access links for each star system's monitoring page
- Implement "Monitor System" buttons on system cards
- Create system overview pages with aggregated celestial body data

### Task 4.3: Galaxy Switching Persistence
- Store selected galaxy in session/cookies
- Maintain galaxy selection across page refreshes
- Add "Remember Last Galaxy" preference option

### Task 4.4: Breadcrumb Navigation
- Design breadcrumb component: Home > [Galaxy] > [Star System] > [Celestial Body]
- Implement responsive breadcrumb display
- Add navigation history with back/forward functionality

## Dependencies
- Phase 3 view structure must be complete
- Galaxy and solar system models must have proper relationships
- Session management system available

## Priority
Medium - Completes the admin dashboard redesign user experience</content>
