# AOL-732356 System Stabilization Documentation

**Date:** 2026-01-15  
**Status:** Stabilizing  
**Compliance:** [Anchor Law](../GUARDRAILS.md#-2-the-anchor-law-stability--infrastructure) ✓

## Topology Analysis

- **Primary Anchor:** Gas Giant 18 (identifier: GAS_GIANT-18)
  - Mass: $5.72 \times 10^{27}$ kg
  - Orbital distance: 4.226 AU
  - Hill Sphere radius: ~1.14 AU
  - **Anchor Law Compliance:** Mass exceeds minimum threshold ($10^{16}$ kg) by factor of $5.72 \times 10^{11}$

- **Natural Wormhole Position:** Located opposite Gas Giant 18 but offset for stability
  - Coordinates: ~8.5 AU from star (opposite side of system from Gas Giant 18)
  - **Counterbalance Effect:** Weaker than Sol's Jupiter due to offset positioning
  - **Stability Classification:** Moderate (less stable than Sol despite larger gas giant)

## Counterbalance Effect Calculation

### Sol System Comparison
- **Sol's Jupiter Counterbalance:** Perfect 180° opposition provides maximum stability
- **Eden's Gas Giant 18:** Offset positioning reduces counterbalance effectiveness by ~40%
- **Result:** Eden system less stable than Sol despite having more massive gas giant

### Mass Limit Calculation with Counterbalance
```ruby
def calculate_mass_limit(system, counterbalance_effect)
  base_limit = 500_000  # Base mass limit in tons
  
  # Counterbalance multiplier (0.0 to 1.0)
  # Sol: 1.0 (perfect counterbalance)
  # Eden: 0.6 (offset positioning)
  stability_multiplier = counterbalance_effect
  
  # Apply counterbalance effect
  adjusted_limit = base_limit * stability_multiplier
  
  return adjusted_limit
end

# Eden system calculation
eden_counterbalance = 0.6  # 60% of perfect counterbalance
eden_mass_limit = calculate_mass_limit(eden_system, eden_counterbalance)
# Result: 300,000 tons (vs Sol's 500,000 tons)
```

## Sweet Spot Calculation

- **Target Position:** Opposite Gas Giant 18 orbital position
- **Offset Adjustment:** +0.5 AU offset to reduce counterbalance effectiveness
- **Final Position:** ~8.5 AU from star
- **Rationale:** Maintains counterbalance effect while ensuring Eden is less stable than Sol

## Station Site Determination

- **Priority Check:** No natural counterbalance at optimal 180° position
- **Counterbalance Strategy:** Deploy AWS at L3 Lagrange point of Gas Giant 18
- **Fallback Selection:** Asteroid XXXV (AOL-732356-AST-35)
  - Distance from anchor: 0.374 AU
  - Mass: $2.44 \times 10^{19}$ kg
  - **Anchor Law Compliance:** Mass exceeds minimum threshold ($10^{16}$ kg) by factor of 2,440
  - Selected for **Phobos Pattern** relocation

## Deploy Logistics

### Tug Mission
- **Target:** Relocate Asteroid XXXV to L3 counterbalance position
- **Tug Type:** Asteroid Relocation Tug
- **Mission Profile:** Phobos Pattern - hollow asteroid for ballast mass

### Skimmer Configuration
- **Distance Check:** Harvest zone to anchor station = 4.274 AU
- **Result:** EM Tanker loops required for stabilization

## Link Metrics & Performance Parameters

### Stability Metrics
- **STE Ratio (Stability-to-Efficiency):** 9,000
  - **Calculation:** Mass Limit ÷ Maintenance Tax = 300,000 ÷ 33.3 ≈ 9,000
  - **Classification:** Moderate-stability route (less stable than Sol)

### Operational Limits
- **Mass Limit:** 300,000 tons (300k tons)
  - **Reduced from base 500k tons due to weaker counterbalance**
  - **Buildup Rate Impact:** Slower infrastructure accumulation delays snap timing
  - Suitable for medium freighter traffic until stabilization

### Economic Parameters
- **Maintenance Tax:** 33.3 EM per transit
  - Adjusted for natural wormhole stabilization requirements
  - Higher effective cost due to reduced stability

## Buildup Rate and Snap Timing

### Slow Buildup Effect
- **Mass Accumulation Rate:** Infrastructure buildup slower due to population/ship limitations
- **Snap Delay Mechanism:** Mass limit reached later, not decreased
- **Timeline Impact:** Years of in-game buildup required before snap trigger
- **Strategic Depth:** Players have time to prepare stabilization infrastructure

### Risk Progression
- **Low Risk:** < 150,000 tons accumulated
- **Moderate Risk:** 150,000 - 225,000 tons
- **High Risk:** 225,000 - 270,000 tons
- **Snap Imminent:** > 270,000 tons (90% of limit)

## Status Update

Link status moved from `unstable` to `stabilizing` in wormhole_contract.json and Wormhole model enum.
