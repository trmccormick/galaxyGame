# Craft Operational Evolution

## Cycler Hardware

### Transferable Units
The cnt_fabricator_unit is a key 'transferable' unit in the cycler system. Unlike permanent equipment that remains on the cycler, CNT fabricators are installed for specific missions and then transferred to permanent infrastructure:

- **Installation**: CNT fabricators are fitted to cyclers before Venus/Mars deployment
- **Operation**: Produce CNTs from local atmospheric CO2 during mission execution
- **Transfer**: Units are transferred to established foundry stations
- **Reusability**: Cyclers can be refitted with new fabricators for subsequent missions

### Hardware Categories
- **Permanent**: Habitat, life support, propulsion (never transfers)
- **Transferable**: CNT fabricators, atmospheric processors, ISRU equipment
- **Reusable**: Construction drones, survey equipment (returns to Sol)

## The "Bootstrap" Protocol

### Foundry Establishment Sequence
The Cycler carries CNT fabricators to establish the very foundries required by the Space Elevator project:

1. **Fit Phase**: CNT fabricators installed on cycler in Sol orbit
2. **Deploy Phase**: Cycler travels to Venus/Mars with fabricators
3. **Establish Phase**: Fabricators transferred to orbital stations, creating foundry capability
4. **Produce Phase**: Foundries begin CNT production from local resources
5. **Deliver Phase**: CNTs transported to lunar construction sites
6. **Enable Phase**: Lunar space elevator construction becomes available

### Economic Bootstrap
- **Initial Investment**: Cycler deployment costs for foundry establishment
- **Return on Investment**: Local CNT production eliminates Earth import costs
- **Scalability**: Multiple cyclers can establish multiple foundries
- **Self-Sustaining**: Once established, foundries support lunar megastructures

## Portable Space Station Evolution

### Cycler as Mobile Infrastructure
Cyclers evolve from simple transport vehicles to portable space stations capable of:

- **Temporary Bases**: Months-long orbital operations
- **Manufacturing Hubs**: On-site production during deployment
- **Construction Platforms**: Assembly and installation support
- **Crew Habitation**: Extended mission support

### Future Capabilities
- **Modular Design**: Swap mission modules between deployments
- **Multi-Role Operations**: Combine harvesting, construction, and transport
- **AI Integration**: Autonomous operation with minimal crew
- **Interplanetary Network**: Connected operations across solar system
