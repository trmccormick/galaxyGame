# Glossary System Mechanics

## Core Concepts

### Portable Space Station Evolution
Cyclers represent the evolution from simple transport vehicles to portable space stations capable of extended orbital operations, on-site manufacturing, and infrastructure deployment. This evolution enables:

- **Mobile Foundries**: CNT production from planetary atmospheres
- **Temporary Bases**: Months-long crew habitation during construction
- **Construction Platforms**: Assembly and transfer of mission equipment
- **Interplanetary Logistics**: Transport and deployment across solar system

### Industrial Chains
Interconnected production loops linking resource extraction, processing, and construction across planetary bodies.

### AI Pattern Learning
The AI Manager's ability to learn from successful deployments and apply patterns to new systems.

### Wormhole Expansion
The process of discovering and colonizing new star systems through wormhole gates.

### The Slag Ratio
The 70% waste material produced during asteroid hollowing operations. This slag represents the unusable portion of asteroid mass that cannot be converted into habitable station volume.

### Shielded Volume
The 30% of asteroid mass that can be converted into functional station space through hollowing equipment. This volume provides radiation shielding and pressurizable habitat for crew and operations.

### Geosphere Simulation
Planetary geological simulation system that models tectonic activity, material distribution, and geological processes. Includes specialized ice tectonics simulation for cryogenic worlds where traditional rock plate tectonics are replaced by slower-moving ice plate dynamics.
