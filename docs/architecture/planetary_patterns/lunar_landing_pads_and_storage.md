# Lunar Harvester Landing Pads & Temporary Storage Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the operational cycles, storage requirements, and infrastructure needs for lunar methane and nitrogen harvesting, focusing on initial Earth resupplies and integration with future Titan harvesters.

## Harvester Cycle Estimation

- **Harvester Type**: Starship Harvester (Venus and Titan configurations)
- **Cycle Duration**:  
  - **Venus Harvester**: ~2000 hours per deployment (~83 Earth days)  
  - **Titan Harvester**: ~2000 hours per deployment (~83 Earth days)  
- **Deployment Frequency**: Every 6 months from Earth initially
- **Operation Uptime**: Approx. 85% during each cycle  
- **Total Harvester Operational Days per Cycle**: ~70 days active harvesting

## Storage Requirements at Luna Base

### Imported Tanks

- Each Earth resupply will bring:  
  - 1 Nitrogen Tank  
  - 1 Methane Tank  
- These tanks are relocated to the lava tube tank farm for long-term storage.

### Temporary Inflatable Storage near Landing Pads

- **Purpose**:  
  - Buffer storage during offloading from Starship Harvesters  
  - Provide gas storage to support refilling of landers for return missions  
  - Support habitat inflation and breathable atmosphere needs

- **Estimated Capacity per Cycle**:  
  - Methane: ~3,000 kg  
  - Nitrogen: ~4,500 kg  
  - Oxygen (from ISRU): ~3,000 kg  
  - Total temporary storage needed near pads: ~10,500 kg (adjusted for pressure and safety margins)

## Infrastructure Requirements

### Landing Pads

- **Number Needed**: 2 pads to allow simultaneous unloading and launch cycles  
- **Features**:  
  - Inflatable tanks for methane, nitrogen, and oxygen near each pad  
  - Pipeline or mobile transfer systems connecting pads to the main lava tube tank farm  
  - Power and maintenance facilities to support harvester docking and processing

### Inflatable Storage Tanks

- **Placement**: Near landing pads (surface deployment)  
- **Capacity**: Scalable modular tanks with total capacity ~12,000 kg gas equivalent per pad  
- **Materials**: Lunar-grade aluminum alloys and carbon nanotube reinforcements for durability and lightness  
- **Connection**: Flexible piping to integrate with main storage farm and habitat life support

## Operational Summary

| Item                   | Quantity | Notes                                   |
|------------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------|
| Landing Pads           | 2        | Supports continuous harvester cycling   |
| Inflatable Methane Tanks | 4        | 2 per pad, buffer and transfer tanks     |
| Inflatable Nitrogen Tanks | 4        | 2 per pad, to support breathable mix     |
| Inflatable Oxygen Tanks  | 4        | 2 per pad, from ISRU oxygen production   |
| Pipe/Transfer Systems   | 2        | Connect pads to lava tube tank farm      |
| Storage Farm Capacity  | Variable | Located in lava tube, long-term storage   |

## Notes and Considerations

- Methane availability on Luna is limited; initial reliance on Earth imports and Venus harvesters is critical until Titan harvesters come online.
- Inflatable storage near pads reduces transfer delays and minimizes hazards during gas offloading.
- Nitrogen import frequency aligns with crew size and habitat pressurization needs.
- Monitoring and maintenance schedules are critical for inflatable tanks due to surface environment exposure.
- Safety buffers and redundancy in storage capacity prevent supply interruptions to critical systems.
