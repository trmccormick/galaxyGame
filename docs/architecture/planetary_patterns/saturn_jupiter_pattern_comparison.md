# Saturn-Jupiter Pattern Comparison

## Shared 3-Tier Elements
| Element | Jupiter | Saturn |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Small Moon Depot | Amalthea/Thebe | Atlas/Prometheus |
| Orbital Depot | Processing/cargo | Processing/cargo + harvester cycle |
| Orbital Station | Construction/repair | Construction/repair |
| Moon Network | 4 Galilean moons | 3 specialized moons |
| Atmospheric Ops | He-3 harvesting | He-3 + Titan methane |

## Saturn-Specific Additions
1. **Titan Surface Operations** (unique 4th tier)
   - Stable surface + thick atmosphere
   - Hydrocarbon production at scale
   - Provides resources for orbital construction

2. **Dual Atmospheric Targets**
   - Titan: Nitrogen/methane (dense atmosphere)
   - Saturn: Helium-3 (gas giant)

3. **Parallel Execution Optimization**
   - He-3 + moon network (Phases 7-10)
   - Timeline efficiency: -30 days vs sequential
