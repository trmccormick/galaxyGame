# System Industrial Chains

## Technical Specs

### Carbon Nanotube Production
- **Power Requirements**: 750 kW per CNT fabricator unit
- **Material Properties**: High-tensile strength of 150,000 MPa, exceptional thermal and electrical conductivity
- **Production Rate**: 100 kg/hour per fabricator from CO2 feedstock

### Interplanetary Foundry Operations
- **Venus/Mars Atmospheric Processing**: CO2 extraction and conversion to CNTs
- **Transport Economics**: CNTs valued at 15,000 GCC per ton for interplanetary shipping
- **Foundry Prerequisites**: Atmospheric processors + CNT fabricator units on cycler platforms

## The Logistics Loop

### Lunar Space Elevator Dependencies
The lunar_space_elevator.json project requires 500,000 kg of carbon nanotubes and is gated by the venus_foundry_established prerequisite. This creates a critical interplanetary supply chain where:

1. Venus/Mars cyclers establish foundry operations
2. CNTs are produced from local atmospheric CO2
3. CNTs are transported to lunar construction sites
4. Lunar space elevator construction becomes available
5. Completed elevator enables direct surface-to-orbit bulk transit

### Supply Chain Economics
- **Cost Reduction**: Eliminates Earth-based CNT import costs
- **Time Savings**: Local production reduces delivery timelines
- **Scalability**: Multiple foundries can support lunar megastructure development
