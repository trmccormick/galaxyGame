## Pattern Learning: Dual-Source Approach

AI Manager learns patterns from TWO sources:

1. **Mission JSON Analysis** (Theoretical Learning)
   - Instant pattern extraction
   - No execution required
   - Identifies structure, dependencies, economics

2. **Mission Execution** (Practical Validation)
   - Success rates measured
   - Refinements identified
   - Patterns validated and improved

Combined approach enables rapid learning with continuous improvement.
