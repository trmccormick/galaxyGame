## Terraforming Patterns

AI Manager learns terraforming techniques from proven Mars deployment:

### Biosphere Engineering Pattern:
- Readiness conditions: Temperature, pressure, oxygen, water, radiation
- Seeding strategy: Population scaling, timing, priority actions
- Ecosystem phases: Microbial → Primary producers → Nutrient cycling → Complex organisms

### Atmospheric Transfer Pattern:
- Transfer modes: Raw (early warming) vs Processed (composition control)
- Transfer windows: Venus (CO₂), Titan (CH₄), Saturn (H₂)
- Efficiency factors: Transport loss, conversion rates, magnetosphere retention

These patterns enable AI to terraform any compatible world without hardcoded logic.
