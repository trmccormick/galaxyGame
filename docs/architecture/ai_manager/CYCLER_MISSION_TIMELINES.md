## Cycler Mission Timelines

AI Manager uses operational data to predict mission duration:

### Venus Harvester Configuration:
- **Total Duration:** 255 days (8.5 months)
- **Phase 1 - Arrival:** 30 days
  - Deploy atmospheric skimmers
  - Begin atmospheric harvest
  - Process gases on cycler (temporary)
- **Phase 2 - Construction:** 180 days
  - Build station from harvested CNT
  - Build depot infrastructure
  - Transfer equipment progressively
- **Phase 3 - Transfer:** 30 days
  - Move processors to station
  - Move fabricators to depot
  - Test permanent infrastructure
- **Phase 4 - Departure:** 15 days
  - Load extracted resources
  - Retract stabilization satellites
  - Prepare kinetic hammer

**Equipment Transfers:**
- To Station: 5 atmospheric processors, 3 CNT fabricators
- To Depot: 4 gas separators, 6 solar arrays
- Returns to Sol: 2 skimmer deployment bays, 2 construction drone bays
- Stays on Cycler: 4 habitat modules, 8 cryo storage units
