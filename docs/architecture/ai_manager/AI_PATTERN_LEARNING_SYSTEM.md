## AI Pattern Learning System

The AI Manager actively learns from successful deployments and stores patterns in JSON format.

### Pattern Categories:

**Corporate Patterns** (`corporate_patterns.json`):
- Corporate establishment sequences
- Economic interdependencies
- Resource flow networks
- Joint venture structures

**Terraforming Patterns** (`terraforming_patterns.json`):
- Atmospheric transfer strategies
- Phase transition logic
- Biosphere engineering protocols
- Infrastructure scaling timelines

**Construction Patterns** (`learned_patterns.json`):
- Deployment success rates
- Required improvements
- System-specific adaptations
- Performance metrics

**Resource Acquisition** (`resource_acquisition_logic_v1.json`):
- Priority hierarchies (local → player → NPC → wormhole → Earth)
- Decision tree logic
- Tuning parameters
- Performance benchmarks

### Learning Process:

1. **Observation:** AI watches rake task execution or mission completion
2. **Extraction:** AI identifies key patterns, dependencies, economics
3. **Storage:** AI saves patterns to JSON with metadata (learned_at, source, success_rate)
4. **Application:** AI applies learned patterns to new systems
5. **Refinement:** AI updates patterns based on deployment outcomes

### Pattern Evolution:
```json
{
  "pattern_name": {
    "learned_at": "2026-01-09T01:46:28Z",
    "success_rate": 0.92,
    "improvements": ["optimize_isru_timing"],
    "refinements": ["add_backup_power"],
    "source": "solar_system_corporate_development"
  }
}
```

As AI deploys patterns repeatedly:
- Success rates improve
- Improvements are identified
- Refinements are added
- Patterns become more robust

This enables continuous autonomous improvement across the expanding wormhole network.
