## Quick Links

- AI Manager Planner (Economic Model section included): `docs/developer/AI_MANAGER_PLANNER.md`

- Blueprint Cost Schema Guide: `docs/developer/BLUEPRINT_COST_SCHEMA_GUIDE.md`

## Notes

- Precursor docs formalize local-first sourcing policy and environment-aware capabilities.
- Blueprints may include mixed cost representations; prefer `cost_schema` when present.
