# Reference Documentation
This folder contains stable reference materials that provide context and guidance for development.

## Contents
- **GAME_DESIGN_INTENT.md**: Core game design principles and intent.

- **ARCHITECTURE_ANSWERS_FOR_GROK.md**: Technical architecture explanations.
- **MASTER_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md**: Implementation strategies and guides.

## Usage
- Read for understanding "why" and historical context.

- Reference when confused about design decisions.

## Maintenance
- Keep stable and authoritative.
- Update only for clarifications, not for new work.
