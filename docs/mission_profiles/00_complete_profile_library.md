# Complete Mission Profile Library

## Overview

Mission profiles are **reusable deployment techniques** learned from Sol's colonization history. Each profile represents a proven pattern for specific system characteristics that the AI can apply to any compatible discovered star system. The system is completely data-driven and system-agnostic - no hardcoded assumptions about specific systems exist (except Sol as the origin point).

**Organizational Implementation**: Development Corporations (DCs) follow foothold protocols to establish initial bases, with AI Manager handling essential operations and terraforming setups. Consortiums like Wormhole Transit Consortium maintain wormhole networks, while TerraGen consortium develops shared terraforming technology between DCs.

## Player Settlement Development

While most initial settlements are established autonomously by Development Corporations (DCs) using these proven mission profiles, players have significant agency in colonization:

### DC-Led Initial Settlements
- **Primary Approach**: DCs (Venus Development Corporation, Mars-focused groups, etc.) handle baseline infrastructure deployment
- **AI Automation**: SystemArchitect service applies mission profiles to establish operational footholds
- **Economic Foundation**: Creates markets and bases for player entry with established logistics and resources

### Player Expansion Options
- **Personal Bases**: Players can build custom settlements/bases using their skills and GCC (Galactic Credit Consortium) funds
- **Intervention Rights**: Players may choose to accelerate, modify, or redirect DC operations
- **Squatter's Rights**: No single entity owns worlds; player developments create competitive settlement dynamics
- **Specialization Choices**: Players can focus on unique economic roles (Venus gases, Titan fuels, Mars metals) or niche operations
- **Risk/Reward Balance**: Player-led developments offer higher potential ROI but require active management and resource allocation

### Integration Mechanics
- **DC Foundation + Player Expansion**: AI establishes core infrastructure, players build specialized or competitive operations
- **Resource Competition**: Player bases compete with DC settlements for resources and markets
- **Consortium Opportunities**: Players can join or form consortiums (like Wormhole Transit Consortium) for large-scale projects
- **Legacy Systems**: Player developments become part of the living simulation, influencing future AI deployments

## Organizational Structure

#### Economic Impact Calculations
**Net Present Value (NPV)**:

- Cost_t: Annual operational costs
- r: Discount rate (typically 0.08 for space missions)
- t: Time period in years
```

**Return on Investment (ROI)**:
```
ROI = (Total Revenue - Total Investment) / Total Investment
Break-even Period = Investment / Annual Net Revenue
```

**Risk-Adjusted Valuation**:
- Technical risk: 20-40% failure probability
- Market risk: 10-30% demand uncertainty
- Political risk: 5-15% regulatory changes

## Pattern Selection Logic

### How ScoutLogic Detects Patterns

The AI analyzes system characteristics using a decision tree:

```
System Analysis
├── Primary Body Classification
│   ├── Large Moon + Resources → Luna Pattern
│   ├── Terrestrial + Thin Atmosphere + Moons + Belt → Mars Pattern
│   ├── Dense Atmosphere + No Surface Access → Venus Pattern
│   ├── Massive Gas Giant + Radiation → Jupiter Pattern
│   ├── Ringed Gas Giant → Saturn Pattern
│   ├── Hydrocarbon Moon → Titan Pattern
│   ├── Distant Ice Giant → Neptune Pattern
│   └── No Match → Generic Pattern
└── Secondary Characteristics
    ├── Resource Availability
    ├── Orbital Mechanics
    ├── Radiation Environment
    └── Accessibility Factors
```

### Priority Order

When multiple patterns could apply, the system uses this priority hierarchy:

1. **Specific Moon Patterns** (Luna, Titan) - Most precise matches
2. **Gas Giant Patterns** (Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune) - Based on planet characteristics
3. **Terrestrial Patterns** (Mars, Venus) - Based on atmosphere and accessibility
4. **Generic Pattern** - Always available as fallback
